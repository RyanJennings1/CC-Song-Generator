Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan 
"Will ye come to the Waxies dargle?" 
Says your aul' wan to my aul' wan, 
"Sure I haven't got a farthing. 
I've just been down to Monto town 
To see uncle McArdle 
But he half a crown 
For to go to the Waxies dargle." 

Cho: What are ye having, will ye have a pint? 
Yes, I'll have a pint with you, sir, 
And if one of us doesn't order soon 
We'll be thrown out of the boozer. 

Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan 
"Will ye come to the Galway races?" 
Says your aul' wan to my aul' wan, 
"With the price of my aul' lad's braces. 
I went down to Capel Street 
To the Jew man moneylenders 
But they wouldn't give me a couple of bob on 
My aul' lad's suspenders." 

Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan 
"We have no beef or mutton 
But if we go down to Monto town 
We might get a drink for nuttin'" 
Here's a piece of good advice 
I got from an aul' fishmonger: 
"When food is scarce and you see the hearse 
You'll know you have died of hunger.

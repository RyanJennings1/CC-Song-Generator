Read the roll of honour for Ireland's bravest men
We must be united in memory of the ten
England you're a monster, don't think that you have won
We will never be defeated while Ireland has such sons

In those dreary H-Block cages
Ten brave young Irishmen lay
Hungering for justice, while their young lives ebbed away
For their rights as Irish soldiers, and to free their native land
They stood beside their leader, the gallant Bobby Sands
Now they mourn Hughes in Bellaghy
Ray McCreesh in Armagh's hills
In those narrow streets of Derry, they miss O'Hara still
They so proudly gave their young lives
To break Britannia's hold
Their names shall be remembered as history unfolds

So read the roll of honour for Ireland's bravest men
We must be united in memory of the ten
England you're a monster, don't think that you have won
We will never be defeated while Ireland has such sons

Through the war torn streets of Ulster
The black flags did sadly wave
To salute ten Irish martyrs, the bravest of the brave
Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty
They gave their lives for freedom, with Thomas McElwee
Michael Devine from Derry, you were the last to die
With your nine brave companions
With the martyred dead you lie
Your souls cry out remember, our deaths were not in vain
Fight on and make our homeland a nation once again

So read the roll of honour for Ireland's bravest men
We must be united in memory of the ten
England you're a monster, don't think that you have won
We will never be defeated while Ireland has such sons
No we'll never be defeated while Ireland has such sons

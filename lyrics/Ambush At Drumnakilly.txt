Once again black flags are hoisted in the county of Tyrone
Three more good men lie butchered by the forces of the crown
We shed tears of grief and anger as the news spreads quickly round
How the SAS had waited and without warning gunned them down.

Now the green flag is wrapped around them
Gloves and berets on their chests
We salute three gallant soldiers
As we lay them down to rest.
 
On the road past Drumnakilly sorrow shrouds thae roadway still
There the Sas men lay in ambush to do Maggie Thatchers will
Like Loughall and like Gibralter British justice has no frills
They came to Tyrone for vengeance and their orders were to kill.
 
Gerry and Martin Harte we've lost you we remember you with pride
You both had so much to live for now your dreams have been denied
Brian Mullin we shall miss you with your friendly smiling face
Though you died with your fond comrades in our hearts you hold the place.

Three brave volunteers are gone what is there left to say
It was Ireland's love that called them when they joined the IRA
So let thatcher send her murderers to the hills of gree Tyrone
It is she who will be mourning when we send her soldiers home.

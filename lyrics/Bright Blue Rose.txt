I skimmed across black water, without once submerging
Onto the banks of an urban morning
That hungers the first light, much much more
Than mountains ever do

And she like a ghost beside me goes down with the ease of a dolphin
And emerges unlearned, unshamed , unharmed
For she is the perfect creature, natural in every feature
And I am the geek with the alchemists stone

For all of you who must discover, for all who seek to
Understand
For having left the path of others, you find a very special hand

And it is a holy thing, and it is a precious time
And it is the only way
Forget-me-nots among the snow, it's always been and so it goes
To ponder his death and his life eternally

For all of you who must discover
For all who seek to understand
For having left the path of others, you find a very special hand

And it is a holy thing, and it is a precious time
And it is the only way
Forget-me-nots among the snow, it's always been and so it goes
To ponder his death and his life eternally

One bright blue rose outlives all those
Two thousand years and still it goes
To ponder his death and his life eternally

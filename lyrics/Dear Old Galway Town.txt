I have travelled all 'round Ireland
From Dublin to Mayo
From Donegal to Kerry, from Leitrim to Sligo
But in all the miles I've travelled
All the roads that I've been down
There's one place I remember best
That's dear old Galway Town

If you ever go to Galway
And just walk down by the sea
I'm sure you will understand
Why it means so much to me
You see the smiling faces
Of the people all around
I'll not forget the folks I met
In dear old Galway Town   

When I go across to England
And meet the people there
There some from Cork and Wexford
And others are from Clare
Each one of them are friendly
But I have always found
You could not meet more nicer folk
Than those from Galway town

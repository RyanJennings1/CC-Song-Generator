I was born and I'll die
With a rebel heart
No, won't apologize for the way that I shine, I'm a work of art
Now I wanna find that

Deep, dark kind of love
That "frick your mind up" kind of love
Bring your heartbeat next to me even when we're enemies
We got that crazy chemistry, you know

You'll only find us followin' our dreams
Rules are only for the dead, asleep
We light up in the dark, we fight for who we are
We got those rebel hearts
We fall like shooting stars, when we love, we go hard
We got those rebel hearts

I was broke, I was down, I was such a mess
But a perfect nightmare
When I woke to the sound of my beating chest
Now I need to find that

Deep, dark kind of love
That "frick your mind up" kind of love
Bring your heartbeat next to me even when we're enemies
We got that crazy chemistry, you know

You'll only find us followin' our dreams
Rules are only for the dead, asleep
We light up in the dark, we fight for who we are
We got those rebel hearts
We fall like shooting stars, when we love, we go hard
We got those rebel hearts

Howlin' like a wolf, I hear you call my name
Let's run away, let's run away
There's gypsy in our blood and we ain't gonna stay
We'll run away, we'll run away

You'll only find us followin' our dreams
Rules are only for the dead, asleep
We light up in the dark, we fight for who we are
We got those rebel hearts
We fall like shooting stars, when we love, we go hard
We got those rebel hearts

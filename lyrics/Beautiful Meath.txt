I've travelled many counties in Ireland
But there's still one I'm longing to see.
It has been a part of my homeland
And it brings back fond memories to me,

Where I wandered alone in my childhood
Reviewing the sights I once seen,
As I walked through the parks and the forests
'Round the beautiful county of Meath.

CHORUS: Oh, beautiful Meath,
you've got all that I need. Y
our rivers they flow with delight.
Your fields are so green,
there's plains to be seen,
And your towns are so gay and so bright.

Fishing down on the Boyne,
I remember the time
You would think it was all just a dream;
And wherever you roam,
there's no place like home
And the beautiful county of Meath.

I've seen its beautiful castles,
And its history I've learned so well.
I've read of the high kings of Tara
And the wonderful book of Kells.

Where the slain still remember St. Patrick,
He lit a fire for the people to see,
'Ere he brought love and kindness to Ireland
And the beautiful county of Meath.

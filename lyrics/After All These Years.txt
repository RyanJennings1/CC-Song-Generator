My darling come to me, set you down easily
and rest awhile by the soft firelight...cold is the night
but warm is my heart with pride
having you by my side
you're still my guiding light After All These Years

Your soft assuring ways, the rock I lean on
saw me through my darkest days
when all hope had gone
you're still the only one, I'll ever hold near
and I love you, after all these years

Time from me passes on, and I'm growing old
a lifetime nearly gone, I cannot unfold...nights dark and cold
but warm is your hand in mine, feeble with ageless time
the light of love still shine After All These Years

Your soft assuring ways, the rock I lean on
saw me through my darkest days
when all hope had gone
you're still the only one, I'll ever hold near
and I love you, after all these years

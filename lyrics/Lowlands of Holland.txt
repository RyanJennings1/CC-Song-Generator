Now when that I was married
And in my marriage bed
There came a bold sea captain
And he stood at my bed head
Saying, 'A-rise, A-rise, young wedded man
And come along with me
To the lowlands of Holland
For to fight the enemy'

Now Holland is a lovely land
And in it there grows fine grain
It is a place of residence
For soldiers to remain
Now the sugarcane grows plentiful
The tea grows on each tree
I only had the one to love
And now he's gone far away from me

Said the mother to her daughter
'Give up your soil and bed
Is there ne'er a man in Ireland?
That will be your heart content
Way there's men enough in Ireland
But alas there is none for me
Since high wind and stormy sea's
Have parted me love and me

I'll wear no shoes all on my feet
No comb all in my hair
I'll wear no handkerchief around my neck
For to shade my beauty fair
And neither will I marry
Until the day I die
Since high wind and stormy sea's
Have parted me love and I

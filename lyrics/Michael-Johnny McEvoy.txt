On a far off August day, cold young men in ambush lay,
On a roadside on a hill where flowers grow,
So much hate for one so young, who was right and who was wrong,
Though a thousand years may pass we'll never know.

Candles dripping blood,they placed beside your shoulders,
Rosary beads like teardrops on your fingers,
Friends and comrades standin' by, in their grief they wonder why,
Michael in their hour of need you had to go.

And when evening twilight came,gentle fell the August rain,
Oh but you lay still and silent on the ground,
As we hung our heads in prayer,in our sorrow and dispare,
We wondered was it friend or foe who shot you down,

Candles dripping blood,they placed beside your shoulders,
Rosary beads like teardrops on your fingers,
Friends and comrades standin' by, in their grief they wonder why,
Michael in their hour of need you had to go.

Now the flame that you held high,when you called out to the sky,
To end this sense less killing and this shame,
Has now passed to other hands and is carried through the land
By some not fit to even speak your name.

The Easter Rising was a launching pad for Michael Collins
At 16 he worked in England and joined the I.R.B.
There he became convinced that independence could
only be achieved by force.
He returned to Dublin Jan.1916 and during Easter week
served as Joseph Plunkett's aide in the G.P.O.
He was described as the most effective officer there.
 
After the rising he was interned in Wales and while
there he set up a branch of the I.R.B. and after his
release in Dec.1916 rose to prominence in the orgnisation
and became a dominant figure in the Irish Volunteers.
He went on to co-ordinate the republican campaign
in the war of independence

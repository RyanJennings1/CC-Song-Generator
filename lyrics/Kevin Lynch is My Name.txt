Kevin Lynch is my name from Derry I came
To this cold H-Block cell
My country free I long to see
An end to this grey hell
It's merely five years I've faced my fears
We went on hunger strike
Took on the British Empire
With their soldiers their guns their might

With Sands and Hughes we got the news
We had the upper hand
But Thatcher would not leave us
All she wanted was our land
McCreesh and Patsy died side by side
On twenty first of May
I knew that then I must join in
To see Ireland free one day

I'd wish to be rid of my prison cell
I often wonder so
If I'll ever be a free man
Or feel the summer wind blow
Now my time it has come
I know I cannot return
To the friends and comrades I'd loved
To my dear old Derry home

With Kieran Doherty next to me
I will not die alone
Over too much long-lived lasting strife
But he will not give in
The strength that keeps me living on
The spirit that lives within
That is why we must fight on
For our freedom we must live

But now I must go I have battled the foe
And paid the ultimate price
Before I leave just listen close
I'll give you some advice
When Ireland's free and our flag flies high
I'll know my task is done
For until then remember the tale
And soon our land will be won

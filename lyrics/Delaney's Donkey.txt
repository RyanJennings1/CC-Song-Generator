Now Delaney had a donkey that everyone admired, 
Tempo'rily lazy and permanently tired 
A leg at ev'ry corner balancing his head, 
and a tail to let you know which end he wanted to be fed 
Riley slyly said ""We've underrated it, 
why not train it?" Then he took a rag 
They rubbed it, scrubbed it, they oiled and embrocated it, 
got it to the post and when the starter dropped his flag 

There was Riley pushing it, shoving it, shushing it 
Hogan, Logan and ev'ryone in town 
lined up attacking it and shoving it and smacking it 
They might as well have tried to push the Town Hall down 
The donkey was eyeing them, openly defying them 
Winking, blinking and twisting out of place 
Riley reversing it, ev'rybody cursing it 
The day Delaney's donkey ran the halfmile race 

The muscles of the mighty never known to flinch, 
they couldn't budge the donkey a quarter of an inch 
Delaney lay exhausted, hanging round its throat 
with a grip just like a Scotchman on a five pound note 
Starter, Carter, he lined up with the rest of 'em. 
When it saw them, it was willing then 
It raced up, braced up, ready for the best of 'em. 
They started off to cheer it but it changed its mind again 

There was Riley pushing it, shoving it and shushing it 
Hogan, Logan and Mary Ann Macgraw, 
she started poking it, grabbing it and choking it 
It kicked her in the bustle and it laughed ""Hee - Haw!"" 
The whigs, the conservatives, radical superlatives 
Libr'rals and tories, they hurried to the place 
Stood there in unity, helping the community 
The day Delaney's donkey ran the halfmile race 

The crowd began to cheer it. Then Rafferty, the judge 
he came to assist them, but still it wouldn't budge 
The jockey who was riding, little John MacGee, 
was so thoroughly disgusted that he went to have his tea 
Hagan, Fagan was students of psychology, 
swore they'd shift it with some dynamite 
They bought it, brought it, then without apology 
the donkey gave a sneeze and blew the darn stuff out of sight 

There was Riley pushing it, shoving it and shushing it 
Hogan, Logan and all the bally crew, 
P'lice, and auxil'ary, the Garrison Artillery 
The Second Enniskillen's and the Life Guards too 
They seized it and harried it, they picked it up and carried it 
Cheered it, steered it to the winning place 
Then the Bookies drew aside, they all commited suicide 
Well, the day Delaney's donkey won the halfmile race"

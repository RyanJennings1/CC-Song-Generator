In a cruel British prison, a brave Irish soldier lies;
Body thin and weak with hunger,
as the light fades from his eyes.
By his side two women weeping,
one is old and one is young;
On their knees to God appealing,
in their soft sweet Mayo tongue.
Ah, my loves, the young man murmurs.
Do not cry your tears for me,
For my time is nearly over,
and today I will be free.
I can see a bright sun shining
on my own green Mayo fields,
And I see dear Michael Gaughan,
waiting there beneath the trees.

In that cruel British prison,
just before the break of day,
With his loved ones there beside him,
that brave soldier passed away.
But he lives in Erin's heart yet,
and wherever flies her flag,
Ireland's sons and Ireland's daughters,
will remember brave Frank Stagg.
Yes he lives in Erin's heart yet,
and wherever flies her flag,
Ireland's sons and Ireland's daughters,
will remember brave Frank Stagg.

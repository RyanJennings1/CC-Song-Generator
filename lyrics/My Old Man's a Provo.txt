Well Charlie's nan's a provo with a beret and a gun
I haven't seen him lately, he's always on the run
He looks so really trendy with his shades and DM boots
Far cooler than those other dads in ties and shirts and suits

The Brits and police all ask me each time that I go out
They ask me if I've seen me dad and if he's been about
I say mind your own business, just leave me alone
You shower are only jealous you've no fathers of your own

Well Charlie's nan's a provo with a beret and a gun
I haven't seen him lately, he's always on the run
He looks so really trendy with his shades and DM boots
Far cooler than those other dads in ties and shirts and suits

On RTE last Friday night a chap came on to say
Please give us information about the I.R.A
He showed a provo unit as cruel as he could be
I know one was me daddy cause he stopped and waved at me

Well Charlie's nan's a provo with a beret and a gun
I haven't seen him lately, he's always on the run
He looks so really trendy with his shades and DM boots
Far cooler than those other dads in ties and shirts and suits

Me da has got me worried I think he's going soft
There's half a ton of fertilizer stored up in the loft
Are you gonna be a farmer da' I ask him just for fun
He said don't be an idiot pass the coffee grinder son

Well Charlie's nan's a provo with a beret and a gun
I haven't seen him lately, he's always on the run
He looks so really trendy with his shades and DM boots
Far cooler than those other dads in ties and shirts and suits

At Christmas time its lonely, me da' is not at home
The police are watching everywhere, they've even tapped the phone
Last Christmas Eve they staked out all our windows and our doors
Then climbing down our chimney came a Provo Santa Claus

Well Charlie's nan's a provo with a beret and a gun
I haven't seen him lately, he's always on the run
He looks so really trendy with his shades and DM boots
Far cooler than those other dads in ties and shirts and suits

Me da' is up in Long Kush To me it's just not right
I say a special prayer for him when I go to bed at night
Today it was his birthday I sent him in a cake
With Semtex in the candles he'll be out before I wake

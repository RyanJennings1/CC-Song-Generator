When first I came to London In the year of 39
The city looked so wonderful, and the girls were so Divine
But the coppers got suspicius, and they soon gave me the knock
I was charged with being the owner, of an old alarm clock

Well next morning down by Marlborough Street, I caused no little stir
The I.R.A were busy and a telephone did burr
Says the judge I'm going to charge you, with the possession of this machine.
And I'm also going to charge you, with the wearing of the Green

Well says I to him, your honour, if you give me half a chance
I'll show you how me small machine can make the peelers dance
Well it ticks away polictly, 'till you get an awful shock
And it ticks away the gellignite, on me old alarm clock

O the judge says listen here my man and I'll tell you of a plan
For you and all your countrymen I do net give a damm
Well the only time you'll take is mine, ten years in Dartmoor dock
And you can count it by the ticking, of your old alarm clock.

Well this lonely Dartmoor City would put many in the jigs
The cell it isn't pretty and it isn't very big
Sure long ago I'd have left the place, if I had only got,
Ah me couple of sticks of gelignite and me old alarm clock

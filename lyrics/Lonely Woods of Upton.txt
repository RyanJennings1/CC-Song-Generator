Many homes are filled with sorrow and with sadness
Many hearts are filled with anguish and with pain
For old Ireland now she hangs her head in mourning
For the men who died at Upton for Sinn Fein

Let the moon shine out along the valley
Where those men who fought for freedom now are lain
May they rest in peace those men who died for Ireland
In the lonely woods of Upton for Sinn Fein

Some were thinking of their mothers, wives and sweethearts
Some were thinking of their dear old Irish home
Did they think of how they drilled along the valley
When they marched out from Cork city to their doom

Let the moon shine out along the valley
Where those men who fought for freedom now are lain
May they rest in peace those men who died for Ireland
In the lonely woods of Upton for Sinn Fein

The warning cry rang out “Fix your bayonets”
And those gallant men they fixed them for the fray
Gallantly they fought and died for dear old Ireland
In the lonely woods of Upton far away

Let the moon shine out along the valley
Where those men who fought for freedom now are lain
May they rest in peace those men who died for Ireland
In the lonely woods of Upton for Sinn Fein

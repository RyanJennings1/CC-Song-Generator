As we gather in song and in story
The memory of Pearse and McBride
Whose names are illumined in glory
And martyrs for long since have died
Forget not the boys of Kilmichael
Those brave lads so gallant and true
Who fought ‘neath the green flag of Erin
And conquered the red, white and blue

So here’s to the boys of Kilmichael
Those brave lads so gallant and true
Who fought ‘neath the green flag of Erin
And conquered the red, white and blue

The twentieth day of November
The day that the tans left Macroom
They loaded in two crossley tenders
Not knowing that they’d meet their doom
But when they came near to Kilmichael
They suddnely came to a stop
They met with the boys of the column
Who made a clean sweep of the lot.

So here’s to the boys of Kilmichael
Those brave lads so gallant and true
Who fought ‘neath the green flag of Erin
And conquered the red, white and blue

Then over the hills went the echo
The peal of the rifle and gun
The flames from the lorries gave tidings
The boys from Kilmichael had won
So here’s to the boys of Kilmichael
Those brave lads so gallant and true
Who fought ‘neath the green flag of Erin
And conquered the red, white and blue

So here’s to the boys of Kilmichael
Those brave lads so gallant and true
Who fought ‘neath the green flag of Erin
And conquered the red, white and blue

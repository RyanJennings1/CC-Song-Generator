As I walked through Kildare while the great row was raging
And little Jimmy Murphy was the lad who was taken

We're far from the last rout
From the East to Downpatrick
Where there dies little Jimmy Murphy on the sweet mossy banks, killamajing, killamajong, whiskey fiskey tooraloo
Rank a diddle dare, ol foldare ol foldoe

Now, little Jimmy Murphy was not hung for sheep stealing
But the courting of a pretty girl and her name was Nancy Whelan

We’re far from the last rout
From the East to Downpatrick
Where there dies little Jimmy Murphy on the sweet mossy banks, killamajing, killamajong, whiskey fiskey tooraloo
Rank a diddle dare, ol foldare ol foldoe

We were marched through the town
We were marched through the city
With our hands tied behind us and the ladies cried pity

We're far from the last rout
From the East to Downpatrick
Where there dies little Jimmy Murphy on the sweet mossy banks, killamajing, killamajong, whiskey fiskey tooraloo
Rank a diddle dare, ol foldare ol foldoe

At the foot of the gallows, poor Nancy was kneeling
At the foot of the rope, then poor Jimmy was reelin'

We’re far from the last rout
From the East to Downpatrick
Where there dies little Jimmy Murphy on the sweet mossy banks, killamajing, killamajong, whiskey fiskey tooraloo
Rank a diddle dare, ol foldare ol foldoe

When Johnny comes marching home again, 
Hurrah! Hurrah! 
We'll give him a hearty welcome then, 
Hurrah! Hurrah! 
Oh, the men will cheer the boys will shout 
The ladies they will all turn out, 
And we'll all feel gay 
When Johnny comes marching home. 
And we'll all feel gay 
When Johnny comes marching home. 

Get ready for the Jubilee, 
Hurrah! Hurrah! 
We'll give the hero three times three, 
Hurrah! Hurrah! 
Well, the laurel wreath is ready now 
To place upon his loyal brow, 
And we'll all feel gay 
When Johnny comes marching home. 
And we'll all feel gay 
When Johnny comes marching home. 

In eighteen hundred and sixty-one 
Hurrah! Hurrah! 
That was when the war begun, 
Hurrah! Hurrah! 
In eighteen hundred and sixty-two, 
Both sides were falling to, 
And we'll all drink stone wine, 
When Johnny comes marching home. 
And we'll all drink stone wine, 
When Johnny comes marching home. 

In eighteen hundred and sixty-three, 
Hurrah! Hurrah! 
Old Abe, he ended slavery
Hurrah! Hurrah! 
In eighteen hundred and sixty-three 
Old Abe, he ended slavery
And we'll all drink stone wine, 
When Johnny comes marching home. 
And we'll all drink stone wine, 
When Johnny comes marching home. 

In eighteen hundred and sixty-four, 
Hurrah! Hurrah! 
Abe called for five hundred thousand more, 
Hurrah! Hurrah! 
In eighteen hundred and sixty-five, 
They talked rebellion--strife; 
And we'll all drink stone wine 
When Johnny comes marching home. 
And we'll all drink stone wine 
When Johnny comes marching home.

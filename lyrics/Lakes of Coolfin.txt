It was early one mornin' young Willie rose
and off to his comrade's bed chamber did go
sayin, "Arise dearest comrades! Let nobody know"
"It's a fine summer's mornin' and a bathin' we'll go!"

Well Willie plunged in and he swam to lay ground
'till he came to an island of soft marshy gound
crying, "Comrades dearest comrades, do not venture in!
For there's false and deep waters in the Lakes of Coolfin

well early next morning Willie's sister arose
and onto her mother's bedchamber did go
sayin', "I had a sad dream 'bout Willie last night
He was clad in a shroud, In a shroud of snow white"

Well later that evening Willie's mother stood there
she was ringing her fingers and tearing her hair
saying woe to the hour young Willie plunged in
For there's false and deep waters in the Lakes of Coolfin

Well I saw a fair maid standing fast by the shore
her face it was sad she was crying for sure
singing woe to the hour young Willie plunged in
For there's false and deep waters in the Lakes of Coolfin

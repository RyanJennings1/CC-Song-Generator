In Derry's hills they mourn a son
Brave an Irish soldier's gone
That fairly kind still bonds on
For Hughes lives on forever

Freedom's dawn has come at last
Judgement for injustice past
Your tyranny it's dying fast
While Hughes lives on forever

A guardian from the hills and dales
Tyrone and Derry loved him well
And tortured in an H- Block cell
Hughes lives on forever

The spurge of Ireland's enemies
The SAS and RUC
And conquered still your spirits free
For Hughes lives on forever

Francis Hughes you're with us yet
Your moral we shall not forget
They feared you then they fear you yet
For Hughes lives on forever

I've met some folks who say that I'm a dreamer
And I've no doubt there's truth in what they say
But sure a body's bound to be a dreamer
When all the things he loves are far away
And precious things are dreams unto an exile
They take o'er the land across the sea
Especially when it happens he's an exile
From that dear lovely isle of inisfree
And when the moonlight peeps across the rooftops
Of this great city wondrous though it be
I scarcely feel it's wonder or it's laughter
I'm again back home in Inisfree

I wander o'er green hills through dreamy valleys
And find a peace no other land could know
I hear birds make music fit for angels
And watch the rivers laughing as they flow
And then into a humble shack I wander
My dear old home I tenderly behold
The folks I love around the turf-fire gathered
On bended knee the rosary is told
But dreams don't last though dreams are not forgotten
And soon I'm back to stern reality
For though they pave the footpath here with gold dust
I still would choose the Isle of Iinnisfree

Far across the sea,
When the Devil got ahold of me,
He wouldn't set me free,
He kept me soul for ransom.
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na...

I'm a sailor man from Glasgow Town,
I've roamed the world around and 'round,
He's the meanest thing that I have found,
In all my days of wandering.
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na...

I could see his evil eyes,
Then he took me by surprise
'Take me to your Paradise, I
want to see the jungle!'
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na...

Chorus: Here we go again,
we're on the road again,
We're on the road again,
we're on the way to paradise.
We love the jungle deep,
that's where the Lion sleeps,
For then those evil eyes t
hey have no place in paradise.
I see graffiti on the wall,
just as the sun was going down,
I see graffiti on the wall,

'Up the Celts, Up the Celts.'
Graffiti on the wall it says,
'We're Magic, We're Magic,'
Graffiti on the wall I see Graffiti on the Wall

And it says, 'Oh, ah, Up the 'RA, Oh, ah, Up the 'RA'
We went through each jungle deep,
For the paradise that he did seek,
T'was no trip for the weak,
We're waltzing with the natives.
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na...

From the Amazon to Borneo,
From Africa to Tokyo,
To the darkest jungles of the world,
But nowhere could I lose him.
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na...
Around in circles everyway,
He turned to me and he did say,
'I think you're leading me astray,
I want your soul me boy-o!'
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na...

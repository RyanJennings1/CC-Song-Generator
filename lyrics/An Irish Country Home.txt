In an Irish country home, One evening long ago
Sat an old man and his little daughter Nell
Said the girl with Irish glee, as she played upon his knee
You promised me a story you would tell

"Come tell me of the past. Of my mother dear." she asked
Come tell me how she used to look she cried
Answering Nell the old man said, as he slowly bent his head
Tears were in his eyes, he then replied

She was sweeter than the blossoms on the clover
She was fairer than the evening sunset glow
But I never will forget how much I loved her
When your mother took my name long long ago
We were married she and I, and in every way we tried
To make our house a home of happiness
'Til a bright septembers morn, on the day that you were born
God took her to a brighter home above

In an Irish country home, one evening long ago
Sat an old man and his little daughter Nell
Though the best of friends must part
She was dearer to my heart
For your mother was the only one I love
For your mother was the only one I love

In an Irish country home, one evening long ago
Sat an old man and his little daughter Nell
Though the best of friends must part
She was dearer to my heart
For your mother was the only one I love
For your mother was the only one I love

Near Aranmore in the County Galway
One pleasant evening in the month of May
I spied a damsel, she was young and handsome
Her beauty fair stole my heart away

She wore no jewels nor costly diamonds
No paint or powder, no none at all
She wore a bonnet with a ribbon on it
And round her shoulder was the Galway Shawl

We kept on walking, she kept on talking
Till her father’s cottage came into view
Said she ‘Come in sir, and meet my father
And for to please him play the ‘Foggy Dew’

I played the ‘Blackbird’ and the ‘Stack of Barley’
‘Rodney’s Glory’ and the ‘Foggy Dew’
She sang each note like an Irish linnet
And the tears flowed in her eyes of blue

She wore no jewels nor costly diamonds
No paint or powder, no none at all
She wore a bonnet with a ribbon on it
And round her shoulder was the Galway Shawl

‘Twas early, early, all in the morning
I hit the road for old Donegal
Said she ‘Goodbye sir’, as she cried and left me
And my heart remained with the Galway Shawl.

She wore no jewels nor costly diamonds
No paint or powder, no none at all
She wore a bonnet with a ribbon on it
And round her shoulder was the Galway Shawl

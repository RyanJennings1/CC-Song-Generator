Oh hark to the tale of young Fergal O'h-Annluan
Who died in Brookboro' to make Ireland free
For his heart he had pledged to the cause of his country
And he took to the hills like a bold rapparee
 
And he feared not to walk to the walls of the barracks
A volley of death poured from window to door
Alas for young Fergal, his life blood for freedom
Oh Brookboro' pavements profused to pour
 
When the smoke and the dim from the battle was over
And Fergal was borne by his comrades away
He asked them to fly from that place and take cover
But he died in the hands of the foe that day
 
God strike from your hands all your hierlings and traitors
The weopens that murdered our brave volunteer
God grant us our freedom, the dreams of O'hAnnluain
And lift from our valleys all sorrow and fear

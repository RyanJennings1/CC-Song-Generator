When on Ramillie’s bloody field
The baffled French were forced to yield
The victor Saxon backward reeled
Before the charge of Clare’s Dragoons
The Flags we conquered in that fray
Look lone in Ypres’ choir, they say
We’ll win them company to-day
Or bravely die like Clare’s Dragoons

Viva la for Ireland’s wrong
Viva la, for Ireland’s right
Viva la in battle throng
For a Spanish steed, and sabre bright

The brave old Lord died near the fight
But for each drop he lost that night
A Saxon cavalier shall bite the dust
Before Lord Clare’s Dragoons
For never when our sabres met
Could we, the Saxon soldiers get
To stand the shock of Clare’s Dragoons

Viva la, the New Brigade
Viva la, the Old One too
Viva la, the rose shall fade
And the shamrock shine forever new

Another Clare is here to leased
The worthy son of such a breed
The French expect some famous deed
When Clare leads on his bold Dragoons
Our Colonel comes from Brians race
His wounds are in his breast and face
The bearna baoghail is still his place
The foremost of his bold Dragoons

Viva la, the New Brigade
Viva la, the Old One too
Viva la, the rose shall fade
And the shamrock shine forever new

There’s not a man in squadron here
Was ever known to flinch or fear
Though first in charge and last in rere
Have ever been Lord Clare’s Dragoons
But see, we’ll soon have work to do
To shame our boasts, or prove them true
For hither comes the English crew
To sweep away Lord Clare’s Dragoons

Viva la for Ireland’s wrong
Viva la, for Ireland’s right
Viva la in battle throng
For a Spanish steed, and sabre bright

Oh Comrades, think how Ireland pines
Her exiled Lords, her rifled shrines
Her dearest hope, the ordered lines
And bursting charge of Clare’s Dragoons
The fling your green flag to the sky
Be “Limerick” your battle cry
And charge, till blood floats fetlock-high
Around the track of Clare’s Dragoons

Viva la, the New Brigade
Viva la, the Old One too
Viva la, the rose shall fade
And the shamrock shine forever new

As I walked through the Glenshane Pass I heard a young girl mourn 
'The boy form Tamlaghtduff 'she cried 'is two years dead and gone' 
How my heart is torn apart this young man to lose 
Oh I'll never see the likes again of my young Francis Hughes 

For many years his exploits were a thorn in Englands side 
The hills and glens became his home there he used to hide 
Once when they surrounded him he quietly slipped away 
Like a fox he went to ground and kept the dogs at bay 

Moving round the countryside he often made the news 
But they could never lay their hands on my brave Francis Hughes 
Finally they wounded him and captured him at last 
From the countryside he loved they took him to Belfast 

Oh from Musgrave Park to the Crumlin Road and then to an H-Block cell 
He went straight on the blanket then on hungerstrike as well 
His will to win they could never break no matter what they tried 
He fought them every day he lived and he fought them as he died 

As I walked through the Glenshane Pass I heard a young girl mourn 
'The boy form Tamlaghtduff 'she cried 'is two years dead and gone' 
How my heart is torn apart this young man to lose 
Oh I'll never see the likes again of my young Francis Hughes

Near Bainbridge town in the County Down
One morning in last July
Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen
And she smiled as she passed me by

From Banrty Bay up to Derry Quay
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down

She looked so sweet from her bare two feet
to the sheen of her nut brown hair
a coaxing elf and I shook myself
for to she she was really there

From Banrty Bay up to Derry Quay
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down

The onward sped and I truned my head
And I looked with a feeling rare
I said says I to a passer by
"Who's the maid with the nut brown hair?"
He smiled at me and he said, said he
"She's the gem of Ireland's crown.
Rosie McCann From the banks of the Bann
She's the Star of the County Down!"

From Banrty Bay up to Derry Quay
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down

The harvest fair she'll be surely there
So I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right
And a smile for my nut brown rose
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
till my plow is a rust colored brown
And a smiling bride by my own fireside
Sits the Star of the County Down

From Banrty Bay up to Derry Quay
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down

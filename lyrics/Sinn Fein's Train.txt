It's the Sinn Fein men on that one stop train
The deal has been done the story's told
There's no turning back take a look at the track
Can't you see it's Green White and Gold.

David Trimble standing there with the conductor Tony Blare
He said please stop the train and I'll be nice 
But David don't you mind if I was you I'd look behind
Here comes wee Jeff with a knife.

Ian Paisley that's your name and your welcome on this train
But it's a one way ticket you've been sold
And if you start to shout then we'll have to throw you out
And there's no discount for the old.

McCrea stood there with McCartney by his side
Their standing on the platform looking soar
You won't march where you want we won't listen to your taunts
It's not an Orange State anymore.

The whistle it has blown, in every house and every home
The Tri Colour's flying all around
The engin it is stoked, the union it is broke
And fares paid in Punts not in Pounds.

The deal has been done the story's told
There's no turning back take a look at the track
Can't you see it's Green White and Gold.

Not Tony's taking notes while Bertie's counting votes
Sinn Fein are on the rise again
And Trimble's blood will boil when the first stop is The DÃ¡il
And five Sinn Fein T.D.'s board the train.

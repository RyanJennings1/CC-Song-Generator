Now when Ireland we rosen up at last
Theres the UDR the Army and the SAS
But the lowest of the low is the foe you do not know
And thats the man they call the supergrass

Singing rifa ter a ludy tera lee
Theres no one who can tell a lie like me
You can search until you tire youll never find a bigger liar
Im the supergrass youve seen me on TV

I can name you people I have never seen
I can tell you places I have never been
For if the moneys right I could tell black was white
I could tell you Gerry Adams loves the queen

Spare a thought for poor Kirkpatrick and for Black
Sure theyre nervous now that Gilmours got the sack
For they put their trust in villains and they took the saxon shillings
Their own hands put the noose around their necks

To my native land I bid a fond farewell
Where Im going is the one thing I wont tell
But Ill keep a watch behind for if anyman should find me
The only place Ill ever go is hell

You might see my face in some exotic bar
In New Zealand or far off Africa
I have no friends or relations I betrayed the Irish nation
Thirty silver pieces doesnt get you far

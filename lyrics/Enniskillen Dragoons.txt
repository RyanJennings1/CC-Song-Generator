Our troop was made ready at the dawn of the day 
From lovely Enniskillen they were marching us away. 
They put us then on board a ship to cross the raging main, 
To fight in bloody battle in the sunny land of Spain. 

Fare thee well Enniskillen, fare thee well for a while 
And all around the borders of Erin's green isle; 
And when the war is over we'll return in full bloom 
And you'll all welcome home the Enniskillen Dragoons. 

Oh Spain it is a gallant land where wine and ale flow free 
There's lots of lovely women there to dandle on your knee 
And often in a tavern there we'd make the rafters ring 
When every soldier in the house would raise his glass and sing 

Fare thee well Enniskillen, fare thee well for a while 
And all around the borders of Erin's green isle; 
And when the war is over we'll return in full bloom 
And you'll all welcome home the Enniskillen Dragoons. 

Well we fought for Ireland's glory there and many a man did fall 
From musket and from bayonet and from thundering cannon ball 
And many a foeman we laid low, amid the battle throng 
And as we prepared for action you would often hear this song 

Fare thee well Enniskillen, fare thee well for a while 
And all around the borders of Erin's green isle; 
And when the war is over we'll return in full bloom 
And you'll all welcome home the Enniskillen Dragoons. 

Well now the fighting's over and for home we have set sail, 
Our flag above this lofty ship is fluttering in the gale: 
They've given us a pension boys of fourpence each a day 
And when we reach Enniskillen never more.we'll have to say. 

Fare thee well Enniskillen, fare thee well for a while 
And all around the borders of Erin's green isle; 
And when the war is over we'll return in full bloom 
And you'll all welcome home the Enniskillen Dragoons.

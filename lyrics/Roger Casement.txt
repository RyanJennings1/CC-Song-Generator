A lonely wave is breaking on the rocky Antrim shore 
And the sighing winds are a keening oe'r the water's solemn roar 
The seabirds sweep to Heaven with a loud and piercing wail 
'Tis the passing knell of one who dies in a lonely English jail 

Along the sweltering Congo swamps, a ghastly silence falls 
And the jungle trees hang lifeless like a thousand funeral palls 
And dark-skinned men a heavy with a fear they cannot name 
While their gentle friend is lead to death with mockery and shame 

Ah, lordly Roger Casement you gave all a man could give 
that Justice be unmocked at and that liberty might live 
But you hurt the high and mighty ones in pocket and in pride 
And that is why they hated you and that is why you died 

They stripped you of your honours and they hounded you to death 
And their blood lust was not sated when you gasped your dying breath 
They tried to foul your memory as they fouled your corpse with lime 
But God is not an Englishman and truth will tell with time 

Ah, gentle Roger Casement you have blessed us in your death 
They have tried to blot you from our minds, but we shall not forget 
Your cause will be triumphant and when slavery's night is oe'r 
Your bones shall rest, your last request, on your rocky native shore

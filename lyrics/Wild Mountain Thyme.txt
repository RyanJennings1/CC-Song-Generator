Oh, the summer time is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather

Will you go lassie, go?
And we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will you go lassie, go?

I will build my love a bower
Near yon pure crystal fountain
And on it I will pile
All the flowers of the mountain

Will you go lassie, go?
And we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will you go lassie, go?

If my true love she/he were gone
I would surely find another
To pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather

Will you go lassie, go?
And we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will you go lassie, go?

Oh, the summer time is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather

Will you go lassie, go?
And we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will you go lassie, go?

They wouldn't hear your music and your paintings they pulled down,
they wouldn't read your writings and they banned you from town.
But they couldn't stop you thinking and a victory you've won,
for you've sowed the seed of freedom in your daughters and your sons.

In your daughters and your sons, in your daughters and your sons,
sowed the seeds of freedom in your daughters and your sons.

Your weary smile it proudly hides the chain marks on your hands,
as you bravely strive to realize the rights of every man.
Though your bodys bent and low, a victory you've won,
for you've sowed the seed of justice in your daughters and your sons.

In your daughters and your sons, in your daughters and your sons,
sowed the seeds of freedom in your daughters and your sons.

I don't know your religion gut one day I heard you pray,
for a world where everyone could work and children they could play.
Though you never realized a victory you've won,
for you've sowed the seed of equality in your daughters and your sons.

In your daughters and your sons, in your daughters and your sons,
sowed the seeds of freedom in your daughters and your sons.

They tortured you in Belfast and they taunted you in Spain
and in that Warsaw ghetto they tied you up in chains.
In Vietnam and Chile they came with tanks and guns,
It's there you sowed the seed of Peace in your daughters and your sons.

In your daughters and your sons, in your daughters and your sons,
sowed the seeds of freedom in your daughters and your sons.

Now your music's playing and the writing's on the wall
and all the dreams you've painted can be seen by one and all.
Now you've got them thinking and a victory you've won,
for you've sowed the seed of freedom in your daughters and your sons.

In your daughters and your sons, in your daughters and your sons,
sowed the seeds of freedom in your daughters and your sons.

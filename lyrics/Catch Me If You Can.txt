I'm a Podcheen, come to the Wadjeen
I got money, and acres of land
I'm looking for a honey, with a bit of money
Catch me if you can, me name is Dan, Sure I'm your man

I like the Cailla, and the Stack of Barley
I like the Waltzes, the Jigs and the Reels
I like swinging, when Big Tom is singing
Catch me if you can, me name is Dan, Sure I'm your man

Chorus
And I'm off to Lisdoonvarna at the end of the year
I'm off for the bit of crack, the women and the beer
I'm awful shifty, for a man of fifty
Catch me if you can, me name is Dan, Sure I'm your man

I've got a brother, he's in the Garvey
I've got an uncle, he's up there in the Dail
He's quite a charmer, he's a mighty farmer
Catch me if you can, me name is Dan, Sure I'm your man

Now to conclude and, finish my story
If there's a young one, looking for a man
Take the bus from Banath, down to Lisdoonvarna
Catch me if you can, me name is Dan, Sure I'm your man

And I'm off to Lisdoonvarna at the end of the year
I'm off for the bit of crack, the women and the beer
I'm awful shifty, for a man of fifty
Catch me if you can, me name is Dan, Sure I'm your man

I'm awful shifty, for a man of fifty
Catch me if you can. Me name is Dan, Sure I'm your man

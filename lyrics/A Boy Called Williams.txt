Time goes by as years roll onwards,
Still in memory fresh I keep,
Of a night in Brlfast prison,
Unashamed I saw men weep.

As the time was fast approaching,
A lad lay sentenced for to die,
On the second of september,
He goes to meet his God on high.

Now he's marching to the scaffold,
Head erect he shows no fear,
And while standing on that scaffold,
Ireland's cross he holds so dear.

Now the cruel blow has fallen,
For Ireland he has given all,
Who in the flower of manhood,
Proudly answered to the call.

Brave Tom Williams we salute you,
And we never shall forget,
Thoes who planned your brutal murder,
We vow we'll make them all regret.

So I say to Irish solders,
If from Tom's path you chance to stray,
Just keep memory of that morn,
When Ireland's cross was proudly borne,
By a lad who lies within this prison grave.

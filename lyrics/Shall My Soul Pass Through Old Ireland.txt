In a dreary Brixton prison 
Where an Irish rebel lay 
By his side a priest was kneeling 
'Ere his soul should pass away 
Then he faintly murmered "Father" 
As he clasped him by the hand 
"Tell me this before I die 
Shall my soul pass through Ireland? 

Shall my soul pass through old Ireland 
Pass through Cork City grand 
Shall I see the old cathedral 
Where St. Patrick took his stand 
Shall I see that little chapel 
Where I pledged my heart and hand 
Then Father tell me truly 
Shall my soul pass through Ireland? 

'Twas for loving dear old Ireland 
In this prison cell I lie 
'Twas for loving dear old Ireland 
In this foreign land I'll die 
Will you meet my little daughter 
Will you make her understand 
Then Father tell me truly 
Shall my soul pass through Ireland?" 

With his heart pure as a lily 
And his body sanctified 
In that dreary British prison 
That brave Irish rebel died 
Prayed the priest that wish be granted 
As in blessing raised his hand 
"Father grant this brave man's prayer 
May his soul pass through Ireland"

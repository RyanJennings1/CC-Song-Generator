By yonder green hill flies the flag na nFianna,
In silence the scouts seem to go to and fro,
Night shades are creeping, soon they’ll all be sleeping,
In the tents nearby where the camp fires aglow.
 
Royal Meath is awaking from yon silent slumber,
The youth of today will inspire the siege,
Hark to their trouble – oh what a triumph,
As they march o’er the mountains in columns of green.
 
Scouts of na mFianna advance o’er the nation,
May every home greet you with joy and delight,
May god give you strength for to love him and Ireland,
And when the day comes give you courage to fight.

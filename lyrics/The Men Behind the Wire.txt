Armoured cars and tanks and guns
Came to take away our sons
But every man will stand behind
The Men Behind the Wire

Through the little streets of Belfast
In the dark of early morn
British soldiers came marauding
Wrecking little homes with scorn.

Heedless of the crying children
Dragging fathers from their beds
Beating sons while helpless mothers
Watched the blood flow from their heads

Armoured cars and tanks and guns
Came to take away our sons
But every man will stand behind
The Men Behind the Wire

Not for them a judge or jury
Or indeed a crime at all
Being Irish means they're guilty
So we're guilty one and all

Round the world the truth will echo
CromweIl's men are here again
England's name again is sullied
In the eyes of honest men

Armoured cars and tanks and guns
Came to take away our sons
But every man will stand behind
The Men Behind the Wire

Proudly march behind our banners
Firmly stand behind our men
We will have them free to help us
Build a Nation once again

On the people stand together
Proudly firmly on your way
Never fear, and never falter
Till the boys are home to stay.

Armoured cars and tanks and guns
Came to take away our sons
But every man will stand behind
The Men Behind the Wire

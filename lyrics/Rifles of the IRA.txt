In 19 hundred and 16 the forces of the crown
To take the orange white and green Bombarded Dublin town
But in 21 Britannia's sons were forced to earn their pay

And the black and tans
Like lightning ran
From the rifles of the IRA

They burned their way through Munster and Laid Lienster on the rack
In Caugnaught and in ulster march the men of brown and black
They shot down wives and children in their own heroic way

And the black and tans
Like lightning ran
From the rifles of the IRA

They hanged young Kevin Barry high a lad of 18 years
Cork cities flames lit up the sky but the brave boys knew no fear
The cork brigade with hand grenades in ambush waiting lay

And the black and tans
Like lightning ran
From the rifles of the IRA

The tans were got taken out and shot by the brave and the valiant few
Sean Treacey, Denny Lacey and Tom Barry's gallant crew
Though we're not free yet, we won't forget until our dying day

How the black and tans like lightning ran
From the rifles of the IRA

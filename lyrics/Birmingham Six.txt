There were six men in Birmingham 
In Guildford there's four 
That were picked up and tortured 
And framed by the law 
And the filth got promotion 
But they're still doing time 
For being Irish in the wrong place 
And at the wrong time 

In Ireland they'll put you away in the Maze 
In England they'll keep you for several long days 
God help you if ever you're caught on these shores 
And the coppers need someone 
And they walk through that door 

You'll be counting years 
First five, then ten 
Growing old in a lonely hell 
Round the yard and the stinking cell 
From wall to wall, and back again 

A curse on the judges, the coppers and screws 
Who tortured the innocent, wrongly accused, 
For the price of promotion 
And justice to sell 
May the judged be their judges when they rot down in hell 

May the whores of the empire lie awake in their beds 
And sweat as they count out the sins on their heads 
While over in Ireland eight more men lie dead 
Kicked down and shot in the back of the head

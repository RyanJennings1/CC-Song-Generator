Sure I'm an Ulster Orangeman, from Erin's Isle I came
To see my Glasgow brethren all of honor and of fame
And to tell them of my forefathers who fought in days of yore
All on the twelfth day of July in The Sash My Father Wore.

It is old but it is beautiful, and its colors they are fine
It was worn at Derry, Aughrim, Enniskillen and the Boyne.
From my orange and purple forefather, it descended with galore
It's a terror to them Papish boys, The Sash My Father Wore.

So here I am in Glasgow town, youze boys and girls to see
And I hope that in good Orange style you will welcome me
A true blue blade that's just arrived from that dear Ulster shore
All on the twelfth day of July in The Sash My Father Wore.

It is old but it is beautiful, and its colors they are fine
It was worn at Derry, Aughrim, Enniskillen and the Boyne.
From my orange and purple forefather, it descended with galore
It's a terror to them Papish boys, The Sash My Father Wore.

And when I'm going to leave yeeze all, "Good Luck," to youze I'll say
And as I cross the raging sea, my Orange flute I'll play
Returning to my native town, to old Belfast once more
To be welcomed back by Orangemen in The Sash My Father Wore.

It is old but it is beautiful, and its colors they are fine
It was worn at Derry, Aughrim, Enniskillen and the Boyne.
From my orange and purple forefather, it descended with galore
It's a terror to them Papish boys, The Sash My Father Wore.

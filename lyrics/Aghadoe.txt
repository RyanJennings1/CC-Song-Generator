There's a glen in Aghadoe, Aghadoe, Aghadoe 
There's a deep and secret glen in Aghadoe 
Where we met my love and I, love's fair planet in the sky 
In that deep and silent glen in Aghadoe 

There's a glade in Aghadoe, Aghadoe, Aghadoe 
There's a deep and secret glade in Aghadoe 
Where I hid from the eyes of the redcoats and their spies 
That year the trouble came to Aghadoe 

But they tracked me to that glen in Aghadoe, Aghadoe 
When the price was on his head in Aghadoe 
O'er the mountain through the wood as I stole to him with food 
But the bullets found his heart in Aghadoe 

I walked from Mallow town to Aghadoe, Aghadoe 
I took his head from the jail gate to Aghadoe 
There I covered him with fern and I piled on him the cairn 
Like an Irish king he sleeps in Aghadoe

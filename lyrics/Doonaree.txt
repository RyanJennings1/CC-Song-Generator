If you ever go to Ireland I'm sure you will agree
To take the road from Dublin town way down to Doonaree
'Tis there you'll find a wishing well beyond a chestnut tree
In a shady nook, by a winding brook
Will you make this wish for me
Oh to be in Doonaree with the sweetheart I once knew
To stroll in the shade of the leafy glade where the rhododendrons grew
To sit with my love on the bridge above the rippling waterfall
But to go back home never more to roam is my dearest wish of all

And if you take the hilly path to the woods where bluebells grow
Where we as barefoot children played so many years ago
You'll find a slumbering castle there enshrined in memory
In a shady nook, by a winding brook
Will you make this wish for me
Oh to be in Doonaree with the sweetheart I once knew
To stroll in the shade of the leafy glade where the rhododendrons grew
To sit with my love on the bridge above the rippling waterfall
But to go back home never more to roam is my dearest wish of all
To go back home never more to roam is my dearest wish of all

Back home never more to roam is my dearest wish of all

Patrick McGinty, an Irishman of note
Came into a fortune, so bought himself a goat
Said he, "Sure, of goat's milk I mean to have my fill!"
But when he got his Nanny home, he found it was a Bill

And now all the ladies who live in Killaloo
Are all wearing bustles like their mothers used to do
They each wear a bolster beneath the petticoat
And leave the rest to Providence and Paddy McGinty's goat!

Missis Burke to her daughter said, "Listen, Mary Jane,
Now who was the man you were cuddling in the lane?
He'd long wiry whiskers all hanging from his chin"
"Twas only Pat McGinty's goat, " she answer'd with a grin

Then she went away from the village in disgrace
She came back with powder and paint upon her face
She'd rings on her fingers, and she wore a sable coat
You bet your life they never came from Paddy McGinty's goat

Little Norah McCarthy the knot was going to tie
She washed all her trousseau and hung it out to dry
Then up came the goat and he saw the bits of white:
He chewed up all her falderals, and on her wedding night:

"Oh turn out the gas quick!" she shouted out to Pat
For though l'm your bride, sure l'm not worth looking at
I'd got two of ev'rything, I told you when I wrote
But now I've one of nothing, all thro' Paddy McGinty's goat'

Mickey Riley he went to the races t'other day
He won twenty dollars and shouted, "Hip Hooray!!"
He held up the note, shouting "Look what I've got!"
The goat came up and grabbed at it and swallowed all the lot

"He's eaten my banknote," said Mickey, with the hump
They ran for the doctor, he brought a stomach pump
He pumped and he pumped for that twenty dollar note
But all he got was ninepence out of Paddy McGinty's goat

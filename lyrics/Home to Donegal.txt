The lights of London, are far behind
The thoughts of homeland are crowding my mind
Familiar places, come in to view
I see my home now, soon I'll see you

We'll talk to the old folk, for they're getting on
And treat them to late nights and sing a few songs
We'll talk of the neighbours, and life in the town
There's so much to tell there, the days fly around

This is my homeland,the place I was born in
No matter where I go it's in my soul
My feet may wander a thousand places
But my heart will lead me back home to my Donegal

Turnaround

And then tomorrow we'll take a walk
Down to St. Marys to a sheltered spot
We'll kneel and pray there
For the ones thatâ€™re gone
And hope they're proud of, their wandering son

The little boats have gone
from the breast of Anna Liffey
And the ferrymen are stranded on the quay
sure the Dublin docks are dying
and a way of life is gone
And Molly it was part of you and me

Where the strawberry beds
Sweep down to the Liffey
You'll kiss away the worries from my brow
I love you well today
and I love you more tomorrow
If you ever loved me Molly love me now

twas the only job I knew
It was hard but never lonely
The Liffey Ferry made a man of me
Now its gone without a whisper
ah Forgotten even now
Sure its over Molly over can't you see

Where the strawberry beds
Sweep down to the Liffey
You'll kiss away the worries from my brow
I love you well today
and I love you more tomorrow
If you ever loved me Molly love me now

Well now I tell my yarns
And I'll spend my days in talking
And I'll hear them whisper Charly's
on the Dole
But Molly we're still living
And darlin' we're still young
And that river never owned me heart or soul

Where the strawberry beds
Sweep down to the Liffey
You'll kiss away the worries from my brow
I love you well today
and I love you more tomorrow
If you ever loved me Molly love me now

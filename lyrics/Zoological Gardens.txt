Last Sunday night, we had no dough
So I took the moth up to see the zoo
We saw the lions and the kangaroos
Inside the zoological gardens

Thunder and Lightening is no lark
When Dublin city is in the dark
If you've got any money, go up to the park
And view the zoological gardens

Well we went out there by Castleknock
Said the moth to me, "Sure now we court by the lough"
Then I knew she was one of the rare old stock
Inside the zoological gardens

Well went went out there on our honeymoon
Said the moth to me, "If you don't come home soon
You'll have to sleep with a hairy baboon!"
Inside the Zoological Gardens

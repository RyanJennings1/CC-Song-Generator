I worked my days on a Galway Farm
In the sun and rain and wind and storm
But once a year I'll chance my arm
And cross the sea to England
I'll scrimp and save 2000 pounds
Spend the week in Cheltenham town
But the racing over always down
I come back poor from England

I dreamed one night before I left
A coal black mare with a white star chest
Crossed the line and beat the rest
I came back rich to Galway
I rose at dawn and drove all day
Thinking, wondering all the way
Lady luck have you come to stay
Or steal away in the morning

When I got to Cheltenham town
Irish faces all around 
No bed or mattress to be found
I slept out on the hillside
I spent three days at the viewing ring
Saw the horses they led in
And just as I was giving in
I stood and stared in wonder

With stamping hooves and steaming breath
A coal black mare with a white star chest
I ran my finger down the list
I matched the name and number
Well Lady Luck had come half way
The horses name was Galway Bay
20-1 were the odds that day
I went to make my wager

I counted out 2000 pounds
Held it high, slapped it down
The bookie smiled but made no sound
I knew what he was thinking
The biggest loser in all the land
With pounding heart and shaking hands
I made my way up to the stand
The horses came to order

But at the first she nearly fell
I cursed my farmers luck to hell
The second and third she took quite well
Way behind the leaders
Then moving swiftly from the back
Found the rails and caught the pack
Ten to go and from the back
Her hooves were drumming thunder

Sheâ€™s catching horses one by one
Bridle flashing in the sun
Eight to go and a mile to run
Two are left before her
Down the straight and on they sped
Left one at the last for dead
Caught the next and by a head
She came home a winner

So I came back to my Galway farm
A wiser and a richer man
But never again I'll chance my arm
Or cross the sea to England
'Cos Lady Luck was mine that day
I held her close and she went my way
I raised a glass to the Galway Bay
And the dream of the Galway farmer

There's a pretty spot in Ireland 
I always claim for my land 
Where the fairies and the blarney will never, never die 
It's the land of the shillalah 
My heart goes back there daily 
To the girl I left behind me when we kissed and said goodbye 
CHORUS: Where dear old Shannon's flowing 
Where the three-leaved shamrock's grows 
Where my heart is I am going to my little Irish rose 
And the moment that I meet her 
With a hug and kiss I'll greet her 
For there's not a colleen sweeter where the River Shannon flows. 

Sure no letter I'll be mailing 
For soon will I be sailing 
And I'll bless the ship that takes me to my dear old Erin's shore 
There I'll settle down forever 
I'll leave the old sod never 
And I'll whisper to my sweetheart "Come and take my name Asthore."

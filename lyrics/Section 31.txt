Who are they to decide what we should hear?
Who are they to decide what we should see?
What do they think we can't comprehend here?
What do they fear that our reaction might be, might be?

Section 31 on the TV
Section 31 on the radio
Section 31 is like a blindfold
Section 31 makes me feel cold, feel cold

The pounding of the footsteps in the early morning light
Another family waking to an awful deadly fright
There's a body on the pavement with a bullet to the jaw
A thirteen-year-old victim of plastic bullet law

The silence in my ears, the darkness in my eyes
Heightens the fear, deafens the cries
Of another brother taken in another act of hate
A family preparing for another dreadful wait

Section 31 on the TV
Section 31 on the radio
Section 31 is like a blindfold
Section 31 makes me feel cold, feel cold

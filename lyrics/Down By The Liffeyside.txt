'Twas down by Anna Liffey, my love and I did stray 
Where in the good old slushy mud the sea gulls sport and play. 
We got the whiff of ray and chips and Mary softly sighed, 
"Oh John, come on for a wan and wan 
Down by the Liffeyside." 

Then down along by George's street the loving pairs to view 
While Mary swanked it like a queen in a skirt of royal blue; 
Her hat was lately turned and her blouse was newly dyed, 
Oh you could not match her round the block, 
Down by the Liffeyside. 

And on her old melodeon how sweetly could she play.; 
"Good-by-ee" and "Don't sigh-ee" and "Rule Brittanni-ay" 
But when she turned Sinn Feiner me heart near burst with pride, 
To hear her sing the "Soldier's Song", 
Down by the Liffeyside. 

On Sunday morning to Meath street together we will go, 
And it's up to Father Murphy we both will make our vow. 
We'll join our hands in wedlock bands and we'll be soon outside 
For a whole afternoon, for our honeymoon, 
Down by the Liffeyside.

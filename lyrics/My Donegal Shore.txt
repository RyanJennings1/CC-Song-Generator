Oh I know it’s not right, reminiscing tonight
Of the days that are gone and returning no more
For the girl I dream of, has a another mans love
Far, far away on a Donegal shore

But why should I care for she’s  happy o’er there
She may have children, she may be wealthy or poor
But I can’t help my dreams of what might have been
If I stayed at home on my Donegal shore

Now it’s winter time there, all the trees will be bare
And the rainclouds will darken my native Gweedore
But if that girl I could hold every raindrop would be gold
It could fall all around us on my Donegal shore

Turnaround

Now there’s none to blame but before she took his name
When she told me she loved him, it hurt to the core
But I could never descend, to be only her friend
So I left her there on my Donegal shore

Now it’s winter time there, all the trees will be bare
And the rainclouds will darken my native Gweedore
But if that girl I could hold, every raindrop would be gold
It could fall all around us on my Donegal shore

But if that girl I could hold, every raindrop would be gold
It could fall all around us on my Donegal shore

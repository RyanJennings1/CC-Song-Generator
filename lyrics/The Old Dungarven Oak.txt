As I went out one morning, going to Dungarven fair
I spied a pretty maiden with the sunlight in her hair
Her way was so delightful, her voice rang like a bell
And as I overtook her, I asked if she was well

Lay down your woollen shawl my love. I swear it is no joke
I'll tell to you the story, of the Old Dungarven Oak

As we approached Dungarven, the girl at me did stare
She asked me why I raised my hat, to a tree so old and bare
I told her of the legend, if the tree should ere come down
There'd be a great disaster, and Dungarven would be drowned

Lay down your woollen shawl my love. I swear it is no joke
I'll tell to you the story, of the Old Dungarven Oak

Turn Around

Well, then she started laughing, my face grew very red
She said that only fools believe, what those old legends said
Her laughter was contagious, now the truth to you I'll tell
By the time we reached the market place, I began to laugh as well

Lay down your woollen shawl my love. I swear it is no joke
I'll tell to you the story, of the Old Dungarven Oak

As I sit here by my fireside, 'tis the autumn of my life
And the darling girl I met that day, well she's now my darling wife
We have a lovely daughter, and a son to push our yoke
And it's all because I raised my hat to the Old Dungarven Oak

Lay down your woollen shawl my love. I swear it is no joke
I'll tell to you the story, of the Old Dungarven Oak
Lay down your woollen shawl my love. I swear it is no joke
I'll tell to you the story, of the Old Dungarven Oak
Lay down your woollen shawl my love. I swear it is no joke
I'll tell to you the story, of the Old Dungarven Oak

Wrap the green flag round me, boys,
To die were far more sweet,
with Erin's noble emblem boys,
To be my winding sheet.
In life l loved to see it wave,
And follow where it led,
But now my eyes grow dim - my hand
Would grasp its last bright shred.

Then wrap the green flag round me, boys,
To die were far sweet
With Erin's noble emblem boys,
To be my winding sheet.

And I had hoped to meet you, boys,
On many a well-fought field,
When to our sacred banner, boys,
The traitorous foe would yield,
But now, alas! I am denied
My dearest earthly prayer,
You'll follow and you'll meet the foe,
But l shall not be there.

But though my body moulders, boys,
My spirit will be free,
And every comrade's honour, boys,
Will yet be dear to me.
And in the thick and bloody fight
Let not your courage lag.
For I'll be there and hovering near
Around the dear old flag.

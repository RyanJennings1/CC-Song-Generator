I'll tell me ma when I come home
the boys won't leave the girls alone
they pull me hair and stole my comb
well that's alright till I come home
She is handsome she is pretty
she's the belle of Belfast city
she's a courtin' one two three
please won't you tell me who is she

Albert Mooney says he loves her
all the boys are fightin' for her
knock at the door and ring at the bell
tell me oh you true love "are you well"
out she comes as white as snow
rings on her fingers bells on her toes
old Johnny Murray say's she'll die
if she doesn't get the fellow with the roving eye

I'll tell me ma when I come home
the boys won't leave the girls alone
they pull me hair and stole my comb
well that's alright till I come home
She is handsome she is pretty
she's the belle of Belfast city
she's a courtin' one two three
please won't you tell me who is she

Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high
the snow come tumblin' from the sky
she's as fine as apple pie
she'll get own own love by and by
when she gets a lad of her own
she won't tell her mom when she comes home
let them all come as you will
it's Albert Mooney she loves still

I'll tell me ma when I come home
the boys won't leave the girls alone
they pull me hair and stole my comb
well that's alright till I come home
She is handsome she is pretty
she's the belle of Belfast city
she's a courtin' one two three
please won't you tell me who is she

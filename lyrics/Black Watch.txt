You've heard about the B-men the cruel RUC
You've heard about the Black and Tans in bygone history
But theres another regiment the devil calls his own
Theyre known as the Black Watch commisioned by the throne

Strolling down the Falls Road with riot guns and gas
Terrorising women as they're coming out of mass
A bunch of Scottish critters we never will forget
Thank God we know the IRA sure arent beaten yet

These soldiers come from Scotland a place you all know well
From the hardest part of Glasgow the teddy boys do dwell
They're given a British uniform they're given a British gun
They joined a British regiment to have themselves some fun

When I grow up and marry and have a little son
Ill tell him of the regiment the terrible things they've done
And when that he grows older becomes a man like me
He'll become a volunteer and set old Ireland free

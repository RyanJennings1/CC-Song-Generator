Where Lagan stream sings lullaby 
There blows a lily fair 
The twilight gleam is in her eye 
The night is on her hair 
And like a love-sick lennan-shee 
She has my heart in thrall 
Nor life I owe nor liberty 
For love is lord of all 

And often when the beetle's horn 
Hath lulled the eve to sleep 
I steal unto her shieling lorn 
And thru the dorring peep. 
There on thye cricket's singing stone, 
She spares the bogwood fire, 
And hums in sad sweet undertone 
The songs of heart's desire 

Her welcome, like her love for me, 
Is from her heart within. 
Her warm kiss is felicity 
That knows no taint of sin. 
And when I stir my soot to go, 
'Tis leaving love and light 
To feel the wind of longing blow 
From out the dark of night

The night was dark and the fight was ended
The moon shone down O'Connell Street
I stood alone where brave men perished
They're gone, they're gone, their God to meet

My only son was shot in Dublin
Fighting for his country bold
He fought for Ireland and Ireland's glory
The harp, the shamrock, green white and gold

The worst I met was a dying rebel
Bending o'er, I heard him say
"God bless me home in dear Cork City
God bless the cause for which I die"

My only son was shot in Dublin
Fighting for his country bold
He fought for Ireland and Ireland's glory
The harp, the shamrock, green white and gold

The next I met was a fair-haired maiden
Kneeling by her lover's side
She prayed to God, her heavenly father
That in his footsteps that she might climb

My only son was shot in Dublin
Fighting for his country bold
He fought for Ireland and Ireland's glory
The harp, the shamrock, green white and gold

The next I met was a grey-haired father
Searching for his only son
I said, "My man, there's no use searching
For up to heaven your son has gone"

My only son was shot in Dublin
Fighting for his country bold
He fought for Ireland and Ireland's glory
The harp, the shamrock, green white and gold

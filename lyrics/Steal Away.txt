Steal away, lets steal away
No reason left to stay
For me and you
Let's start a-new
And darling steal away
Let's steal away and chase some dreams
And hope they never find us
The dreary days
The empty nights
We'll leave them all behind us
Steal away, lets steal away
No reason left to stay
For me and you
Let's start a-new
And darling steal away
We'll leave behind the city streets
The gloom and desolation
The rain the cold
Just growing old
God knows its a hard old station
Steal away, let's steal away
No reason left to stay
For me and you
Let's start a-new
And darling steal away
We'll leave with just our memories
And make a new beginning
We have to choose
To win or lose
And it's time we started winning
Steal away, let's steal away
No reason left to stay
For me and you
Let's start a-new
And darling steal away
Steal away, let's steal away
No reason left to stay
For me and you
Let's start a-new
And darling steal away

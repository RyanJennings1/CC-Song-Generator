All honour to Óglaigh na hÉireann 
All praisec to the men of our race 
Who in days of betrayal and slavery 
Saved Ireland from ruin and disgrace 
But do not forget in your praising 
Of them and the deeds they have done 
Their loyal and true-hearted comrades 
The soldiers of Cumman na mBann 

They stand for the honour of Ireland 
As their sisters in days that have gone 
They march with their comrades to freedom 
The soldiers of Cumman na mBann 

No brave-hearted daughter of Ireland 
Who died for her sake long ago 
Who stood in the Gap of Danger 
Defying assassin and foe 
Was ever more valiant or worthy 
Of glory and high sounding rann 
Than the comrades of Óglaigh na hÉireann 
The soldiers of Cumman na mBann 

They stand for the honour of Ireland 
As their sisters in days that have gone 
They march with their comrades to freedom 
The soldiers of Cumman na mBann 

High beats the heart of our mother 
The day she has longed for is nigh 
When the sunlight of joy and of freedom 
Shall glow in the eastern sky 
And none shall be honoured more proudly 
That morning by chieftan and clan 
Than the comrades of Óglaigh na hÉireann 
The soldiers of Cumman na mBann 

They stand for the honour of Ireland 
As their sisters in days that have gone 
They march with their comrades to freedom 
The soldiers of Cumman na mBann

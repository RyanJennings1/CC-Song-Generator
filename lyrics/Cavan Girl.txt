As I walk the road from Kilashandra, weary eyes are down
for it's twelve long miles around the lake to get to Cavan Town
lough after on the road I go, one scene beyond compare
and I curse the time it takes to reach my Cavan girl so fair

now the autumn shades are on the leave, the trees will soon be bare
each red hued leaf around me seems the color of her hair
my gaze retreats, defies my feet and once again I sigh
for each broken blue around seems the colour of her eyes

at the Cavan Cross each Sunday morning, there she can be found
and it seems she has the eye of every boy in Cavan Town
if my luck will hold, I'll catch the golden Summer of her smile
and I'll break the hearts of Cavan men for she'll talk with me awhile

so next Sunday evening finds me homeward, Kilashandra bound
to work a week 'till I return to court in Cavan Town
when asked if she would be my wife at least she's not said no
so next Sunday early, 'rouse myself, and back to her I'll go

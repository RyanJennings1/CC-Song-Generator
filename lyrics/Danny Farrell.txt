I knew Danny Farrell when his football was a can.
In his hand me down's and wellers and sandwiches of grand,
But now this pave ment pesent, is a full grown bitter man,
With all his trials and troubles, of hes travelling people's clan

He's a looser a boozer, me and you user,
A rater a traitor, peoples police hater,
So lonely and only, what you call a gurrier,
Still now, Danny Farrell he's a man.

I knew Danny Farrell when he joined the national school,
He was lousy at the gaelic, called him amadan and fool
He was briliant at the toss school
Or traiding objects in the pown
By the time he was an adult all his charming ways were gone.

He's a looser a boozer, me and you user,
A rater a traitor, peoples police hater,
So lonely and only, what you call a gurrier,
Still now, Danny Farrell he's a man.

I knew Dannd Farrell when he queued up for the dole,
And he tried to hide his loss of pride,
That eats away the soul,
Mending pots and kettles, is a trade lost in the past.
Theres no hand out's here for tinkeres was the answer when he asked.

He's a looser a boozer, me and you user,
A rater a traitor, peoples police hater,
So lonely and only, what you call a gurrier,
Still now, Danny Farrell he's a man.

I still know Danny Farrell, saw him just there yesterday,
Drinking methylated spirits, with some winos on the quay,
Now he's fourty going on eighty, with his eyes of hope bereft,
And he told me this for certain, theres not many of us left,

He's a looser a boozer, me and you user,
A rater a traitor, peoples police hater,
So lonely and only, what you call a gurrier,
Still now, Danny Farrell he's a man.

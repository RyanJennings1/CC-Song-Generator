I'll sing you of an army brave who fights from the cradle to the grave
The people they'll no longer slay for the INLA freedom fighters.
Followers of Connolly they fight to bring us liberty,
Socialism we might see with the INLA freedom fighters.
"Saoirse Go Deo" is our cry! The Starry Plough our flag flies high!
England's tyranny we defy! Were the INLA freedom fighters!

Rising throughout the land Connolly in head: gun in hand,
The working class will take a stand with the INLA freedom fighters,
Fighting for the working class, the priest condemns us at the Mass,
But this will not turn us from our task as the INLA freedom fighters.
To meet the Tory tyrants greed, a volunteer a bomb did leave,
To kill the imperial Airey Neave 'twas they the freedom fighters!

Murder, torture, imprisonment, our movement is still not spent,
We vow to make our foes relent were the INLA freedom fighters.
The Brits try to criminalise our comrades, who on The Blanket lie,
Make sure that the fight does not subside; were the INLA freedom fighters.
Captured guerrillas to jail are sent, prisoners of war, their time is spent,
With heads unbowed and knees unbent - one broken freedom fighter.

The news in 1981 a hunger strike for rights begun,
But an empty victory was won for all the freedom fighters.
At British hands died Bobby Sands, McCreesh and Hughes for the Five Demands,
OHaras death our symbol stands, were the INLA freedom fighters.
Aye on beneath our banners high, to avenge our comrades who have died,
Let the fight go on as Patsy said for the INLA freedom fighters.

I'll sing you of an army brave who fights from the cradle to the grave
The people they'll no longer slay for the INLA freedom fighters.
Followers of Connolly they fight to bring us liberty,
Socialism we might see with the INLA freedom fighters.
"Saoirse Go Deo" is our cry! The Starry Plough our flag flies high!
England's tyranny we defy! We're the INLA freedom fighters!

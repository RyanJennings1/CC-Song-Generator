Oh, Glory-O! Now I'm the Lord's disciple.
Oh, Glory-O! Now hand me down me bible.

I like my liquor and my livin' hard. May the Lord save my soul.
My salvation was the turn of card. My heart's as black as coal,
But everybody's got the right to go wrong
Everybody's got to sing my song.
Everybody's got the right to go wrong.
Sing my song. Sing my song.

Oh, Glory-O! Now I'm the Lord's disciple.
Oh, Glory-O! Now hand me down me bible.

I don't give a damn for any man, as all the world can see.
The time has come to make a stand, to shine your light on me.
Come on, people. Let your life begin.
Come on now. Let the sun shine in.
Come on, people. Let your life begin.
Let it in. Let it in.

Oh, Glory-O! Now I'm the Lord's disciple.
Oh, Glory-O! Now hand me down me bible.

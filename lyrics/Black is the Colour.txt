Black is the color
of my true love's hair
her lips are like
some roses fair
she's the sweetest smile
and the gentlest hands
and I love the ground
where on she stands

I love my love
and well she knows
I love the ground
where on she goes
if she on earth no more I'll see
My life will quickly fade away

I'll go to the Clyde
and I'll mourne and weep
for satisfied
I'll never be
I'll write her a letter
just a few short lines
and suffer death a 1000 times

Winter's past and the leaves are green
the time has passed that we have seen
but still I hope the time will come
when she and I will be as one

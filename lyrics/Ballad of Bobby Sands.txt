Come gather round me one and all 
My song to you I'll sing, 
In memory of a brave young Irishman, 
Who would not concede defeat, 
From his stand would not retreat. 
I sing of the gallant Bobby Sands, 
Bobby Sands. 
Yes I sing of the late great Bobby Sands. 

He organised the hunger strike 
To win and change, reform, 
To stop the evil tyrants in their craze, 
To regain the five demands 
He took his young life in his hands 
For the betterment of comrades in Armagh 
And in the Maze 
Armagh and the H-Blocks of the Maze. 

They tried to break your spirit 
But no way could they succeed, 
The phoenix in your heart they tried to quell 
With their beatings, degradation, 
All in vain totheirfrustration, 
For the more they tried, the more you would rebel 
You would rebel, 
With dignity your principle did swell. 

But freedom was to come to you 
On a rain soaked Tuesday morn 
From the heavens tears of patriots were shed 
With the joy that you are free 
To walk with Tone and Connolly, 
Forever live the name of Bobby Sands 
We shall endear 
Your name, to foe shall always threaten tear. 

So to all you people 
My song to you I've sung 
In memory of a brave young Belfast man 
Who would not concede defeat, 
From his stand would not retreat. 
I sing of the gallant Bobby Sands, 
Bobby Sands. 
Yes I sing of the late great Bobby Sands.

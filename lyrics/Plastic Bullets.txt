In Belfast streets I've heard it said,
They're shooting little children dead,
Taking lives hardly begun,
With plastic bullets in their guns.

We won't be kept down easily,
We will not be still,
We will not be kept down easily,
After all you maimed and killed.

Young Carol Ann, just 12 years of age
Shot down by Brits in bloody rage,
Wee Julie Livingstone as well,
Fell victim to their, plastic hell.

We won't be kept down easily,
We will not be still,
We will not be kept down easily,
After all you maimed and killed.

They try to make us toe their line,
By using every type of crime,
But, freedom won't be terrorised,
Nor freedom's struggle, criminalised

We won't be kept down easily,
We will not be still,
We will not be kept down easily,
After all you maimed and killed.

They tried to drag us from our streets,
By taking lives so young and sweet,
Do they not know, we'll not be beat,
And that violence is their own defeat.
We won't be kept down easily,
We will not be still,
We will not be kept down easily,
After all you maimed and killed.
We won't be kept down easily,
We will not be still,
We will not be kept down easily,
After all you maimed and killed.
After all you maimed and killed.
After all you maimed and killed.

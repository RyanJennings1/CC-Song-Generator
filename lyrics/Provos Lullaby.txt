So go to sleep my weary Provo let the time go drifting by
Cant you hear the bullets humming thats a Provos lullaby

Well I know your clothes are worn and tattered
And your hair its turning slightly grey
Some day youll die and go to heaven
Youll find peace again some day

So go to sleep my weary Provo let the time go drifting by
Cant you hear the bullets humming thats a Provos lullaby

Well I know the peelers give you trouble
Sure they cause trouble everywhere
Some day youll die and go to heaven
They'll be no black bastards (RUC) over there

So go to sleep my weary Provo let the time go drifting by
Cant you hear the bullets humming thats a Provos lullaby

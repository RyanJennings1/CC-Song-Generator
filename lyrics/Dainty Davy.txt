It was in and through the window broads
And a' the tirlie wirlies o't
The sweetest kiss that e'er I got
Was from my Dainty Davie.

Oh, leeze me on your curly pow
Dainty Davie, Dainty Davie
Leeze me on your curly pow
My ain dear Dainty Davie.

It was doon amang my Daddy's pease
And underneath the cherry trees
Oh, there he kissed me as he pleased
For he was my ain dear Davie.

Oh, leeze me on your curly pow
Dainty Davie, Dainty Davie
Leeze me on your curly pow
My ain dear Dainty Davie.

When he was chased by a dragoon
Into my bed he was laid doon
I thought him worthy o' his room
For he's my Dainty Davie.

Oh, leeze me on your curly pow
Dainty Davie, Dainty Davie
Leeze me on your curly pow
My ain dear Dainty Davie.

Oh, leeze me on your curly pow
Dainty Davie, Dainty Davie
Leeze me on your curly pow
My ain dear Dainty Davie.

When winter was brawling, o'er high hills and mountains
And dark were the clouds o'er the deep rolling sea,
I spied a wee lass as the daylight was dawning
She was asking the road to sweet Carnlough Bay.

I said,"My fair lass, I surely will tell ye
The number of miles or how far it might be
But if you'll consent I'll convoy you a wee bit
And I'll show you the road to sweet Carnlough Bay.

You turn to the right and pass down by the churchyard
Cross over the river and down by the sea;
We'll call in Pat Hamill's and have a wee drop there
Just to help us along to sweet Carnlough Bay.

Here's a health to Pat Hamill likewise the dear lassie
And to every laddie that's listening to me
And ne'er turn your back on a bonnie young lassie
When she's asking the road to sweet Carnlough Bay.

Oh see the fleet foot host of men who sped with faces wan
from Farmsead and from Fisher's Scot down to the Banks of Bann
They come with vengeance in their eyes too last, too late are they
for young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the Bridge of Taum today

up the narrow street he steps smiling proud and young
about that hemp rope 'round his neck, his golden ringlets clung
there was ne're a tear in his blue eyes, both glad and bright are they
for young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the Bridge of Taum today

when he last stepped up that street, his shining pike in hand
behind him marches in grim array a stalward honest band
for Antrim Town, for Antrim Town, he led them to the fray
for young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the Bridge of Taum today

There was ne're a one of all your dead so bravely fell in fray
as he who marches to his death on the bridge of Taum today
true to the last, true to the last, he treads the upward way
and young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the Bridge of Taum today

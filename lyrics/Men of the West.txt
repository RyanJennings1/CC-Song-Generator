While you honour in song and in story
The names of the patriot men
Whose valour has covered with glory
Full many a mountain and glen
Forget not the boys of the heather
Who marshalled their bravest and best
When Ireland was broken in Wexford
And looked for revenge in the West

I give you the gallant old West, boys
Where rallied our bravest and best
When Ireland was broken and bleeding
Hurrah for the men of the West

The hilltops with glory were glowing
'Twas the eve of a bright harvest day
When the ships we'd been wearily waiting
Sailed into Killala's broad bay
And over the hill went the slogan
To waken in every breast
The fire that has never been quenched, boys
Among the true hearts of the West

I give you the gallant old West, boys
Where rallied our bravest and best
When Ireland was broken and bleeding
Hurrah for the men of the West

Killala was ours ere the midnight
And high over Ballina town
Our banners in triumph were waving
Before the next sun had gone down
We gathered to speed the good work, boys
The true men anear and afar
And history can tell how we routed
The redcoats through old Castlebar

I give you the gallant old West, boys
Where rallied our bravest and best
When Ireland was broken and bleeding
Hurrah for the men of the West

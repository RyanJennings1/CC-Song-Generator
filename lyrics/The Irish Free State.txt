I went to see David, to London to David
I went to see David, and what did he do?
He gave me a Free State, a nice little Free State
A Free State that's bound up with Red, White and Blue
I brought it to Dublin to show to Dail Eirann
I brought it to Dublin, and what did they do?
They asked me what kind of a thing was a Free State
A Free State that's tied up  with Red, White and Blue

"Three quarters of Ireland a nation," I told them
"Tied on to the Empire with Red, White and Blue;
And an oath they must swear to King George and Queen Mary
An oath they must swear to the son-in-law new
I'm teaching them Irishand painting their boxes
All over with green, sure, what more can I do?
Yet they tell me they want just an Irish Republic
Without any trimmings of Red, White and Blue!

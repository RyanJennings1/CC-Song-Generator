True you ride the finest horse I've ever seen
Standing sixteen one or two with eyes wild and green
You ride the horse so well hands light to the touch
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to

Ride on, see you
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
Ride on, see you
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to

When you ride into the night without a trace behind
Run your claw along my gut, one last time
I turn to face an empty space, where you used to lie
And look for a spark that lights the night
Through a teardrop in my eye

Ride on, see you
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
Ride on, see you
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to

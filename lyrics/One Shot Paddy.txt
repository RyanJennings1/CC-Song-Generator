In Ireland many years ago or so the legend says
Saint Patrick roamed the hills and glens to drive the snakes away,
But now we have another another saint that's bad news for the crown
His name is "One Shot Paddy" and it's Brits that he will hound!

The brits are getting worried they've all gone underground
If 'One Shot Paddy' sees them they know they're going down
So the next time that you see the Brits with their faces full of fright
Look out for 'One Shot Paddy' and his friend called Eamon Wright!

Through the hills of South Armagh this gallant hero roams
He'll wander through the countryside he likes to call his home,
And when he finds a target he will quietly take his aim,
It is then that you will hear the crack and the Brits know who's to blame!

The brits are getting worried they've all gone underground
If 'One Shot Paddy' sees them they know they're going down
So the next time that you see the Brits with their faces full of fright
Look out for 'One Shot Paddy' and his friend called Eamon Wright!

So if you're home at night and the newsflash it is red,
Your man from South Armagh's at work â€“ another soldier dead,
And when it comes to celebrate Saint Patrick's day cheer,
Remember 'One Shot Paddy' and the gallant IRA!

The brits are getting worried they've all gone underground
If 'One Shot Paddy' sees them they know they're going down
So the next time that you see the Brits with their faces full of fright
Look out for 'One Shot Paddy' and his friend called Eamon Wright!

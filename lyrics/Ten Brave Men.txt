Bobby Sands was his name, He Died for the cause of Freedom 
A hunger strike they commenced, To fight for the right as Freemen 
In the Summer of 81' Ten brave men, the Crown they took on 
The ten were prisoners of war...But Englands leaders let them die one by one 
The year they murdered Ten Brave men, and the Black flags were flying'
The Year they murdered Ten Brave men, and all the people were crying' They sang 

"Lord we have lost our son's, now we'll make sure this war is won" 

Bobby was elected MP, and one day he said to me, 
"People must fight for the right to live in a land thats free" 
I Got 14 years in Jail, and this hunger strike it must not fail. 
The English we'll alway's detest, but they should never have taken the very best. 

The year they murdered Ten Brave men, and the Black flags were flying' 
The Year they murdered Ten Brave men, and all the people were crying' They sang 
"Lord we have lost our son's, now we'll make sure this war is won" 

The year they murdered Ten Brave men, and the Black flags were flying' 
The Year they murdered Ten Brave men, and all the people were crying' They sang 
"Lord we have lost our son's, now we'll make sure this war is won" 

Like His father before him, He was a workin' man 
Like his Comrades beside him, He took a Rebel stand 
He was a Rebel, proud and brave, but Thatcher laid him in his grave 
I swear by the blood in my vains, The Irish people will someday have their say. 

The year they murdered Ten Brave men, and the Black flags were flying' 
The Year they murdered Ten Brave men, and all the people were crying' They sang 
"Lord we have lost our son's, now we'll make sure this war is won" 

The year they murdered Ten Brave men, and the Black flags were flying' 
The Year they murdered Ten Brave men, and all the people were crying' They sang, 
"Lord we have lost our son's, now we'll make sure this war is won"

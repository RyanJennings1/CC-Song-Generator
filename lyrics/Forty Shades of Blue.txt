Oh it's midnight on the Bowery and your feet are soakin' wet 
And you've drank your last brass farthin' 
You'd sell your soul for a cigarette 
And the sounds from CBGBs are comfortin' to you 
Then you think of the green fields of Ireland 
And you feel 40 shades of blue 

Ah you're back on the drink since September 
And your head feels like a sieve 
And you know that you're goin' from bad to worse 
But you just don't give a shit 
And the hymns from the Sally Army sound heavenly and true 
Then you think of your friends and your family 
And you feel 40 shades of blue 

Ah you've got a great future behind you 
But you're goin' nowhere fast 
Just up and down the Bowery from Canal Street to old St. Marks 
And you wonder what she's up to now 
Did she really find somebody new 
Ah how the hell could she just walk out like that 
On your 40 shades of blue 

And you wonder how it came to this 
Was it always in the cards 
'Cause workin' is for idiots 
And you loved the smell of bars 
And the letters that you sent back home 
Were full of all the things you'd done 
But they don't say you're down there on Bleecker Street 
With your hand out on the bum 

Now the dawn's comin' up on the Bowery 
And you're heartsick and soakin' wet 
With your tongue hangin' out for some Irish Rose 
You'd sell your soul for a cigarette 
"And someday I'm gonna give up this drinkin' 
But then maybe someday I'll win the lottery too 
Then I'll go back home to old Wexford Town 
And paint her 40 shades off blue"

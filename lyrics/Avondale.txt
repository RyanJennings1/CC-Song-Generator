Oh, have you been to Avondale
And lingered in her lovely vale?
Where tall trees whisper low the tale
Of Avondale's proud eagle

Where pride and ancient glory fade
Such was the land where he was laid
Like Christ was thirty pieces paid
For Avondale's proud eagle

Long years that green and lovely glade
Have lost for now our grandest Gael
And Cursed the land that has betrayed
Our Avondale's proud eagle

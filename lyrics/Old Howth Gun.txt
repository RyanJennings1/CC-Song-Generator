There is sorrow in my heart
O me old Howth gun.
That we lately had to part
O me old Howth gun.
In Ireland’s day of need,
Ah you proved a friend indeed
When you made the bullets speed
O me old Howth gun

I was glad when you were near
O me old Howth gun.
For the foeman did I fear
O me old Howth gun.
When your bark and bitter bite
Put the Saxon course to flight
And he didn’t stop to fight
O me old Howth gun

O how glorious was your feel
O me old Howth gun.
When you made the Saxon reel
O me old Howth gun
When the Lancers trimmin’ neat
Came chargin down O’Connell Street
And they beat a grim retreat
O me old Howth gun

O the parting it was sore
O me old Howth gun.
Shall I ne’er see you no more
O me old Howth gun.
There is glorious hopes that we
Could have set old Ireland free
But now your parted far from me
O me old Howth gun

O the day will surely come
O me old Howth gun.
When I’ll join the fightin’ men
O me old Howth gun
In some brave determined band
I shall surely take my stand
For the freedom of our land
O me old Howth gun.

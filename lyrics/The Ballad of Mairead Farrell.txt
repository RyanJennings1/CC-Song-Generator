Do not stand at my grave and weep,
I am not there I do not sleep,
Do not stand at my grave and cry,
When Ireland lives I do not die.

 
A woman's place is not at home,
The fight for freedom it still goes on,
I took up my gun until freedoms day,
I pledged to fight for the I.R.A.

In Armagh jail I served my time,
Strip searches were a British crime,
Degraded me but they could not see,
I'd suffer this to see Ireland free.

 
Gibraltar was the place I died,
McCann and Savage were by my side,
I heard the order so loud and shrill,
Of Thatchers voice, said shoot to kill.

 
So do not stand at my grave,
I am not there I do not sleep,
Do not stand and my grave and cry,
When Ireland lives I do not die.

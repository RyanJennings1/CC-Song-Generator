'Twas down by the glenside
I met an old woman
a pluckin' young nettles
she ne'er saw me comin'

I listened a while t
o the song she was hummin'
Glory-O, Glory O to the Bold Fenian Men

When I was a young girl
their marchin & Drillin
awoke in the glen sound
awesome & thrillin
they loved poor old Ireland
& to die they were willin
Glory-O, Glory O to the Bold Fenian Men

It's 50 long years
since I saw the moon beamin
on strong manly forms
& on eyes with hope gleamin
sure I seen them again
through all my day dreamin
Glory-O, Glory O to the Bold Fenian Men
I passed on my way
God be praised that I met her
Be life long or short sure
I'll never forget her
we may have great men
but we'll never have better
Glory-O, Glory O to the Bold Fenian Men

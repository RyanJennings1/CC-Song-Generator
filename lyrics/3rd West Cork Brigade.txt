We'll raise our voices in Ireland's praise
Glad are our hearts to-day,
For Ireland's sons have proved their worth
In the good old I.R.A.
All parts fought well for Roisin Dubh
But we a record made.
In good old Cork, in famed West Cork,
The Third West Cork Brigade.
 
At Newcestown we struck a blow
For Ireland and Sinn Fein.
At Ballinhassig next we proved
Our rights we would maintain.
The English foe we twice laid low,
We faced them undismayed.
In good old Cork, in famed West Cork,
The Third West Cork Brigade.
 
The Black and Tans to Ireland came
To send us to our doom.
Their doughtiest warriors sallied forth
In lorries from Macrom.
But at Kilmichael's bloody fight
Their conquering course was stayed
By good old Cork, by famed West Cork,
The Third West Cork Brigade.
 
Then at Crosbarry's battlefield
Our gallant boys saw red.
For ten to one the Saxon host
Before our onslaught fled.
And o'er the hills we made our way
While our gallant piper played
In good old Cork, in famed west Cork
The third west Cork brigade
 
Our boys fought well in every fight
we need not call a name
But Commandants Hales and Barry
Are now well known to fame
Napoleon like they led us on
with courage we obeyed
In good old Cork, in famed West Cork
The Third West Cork Brigade.
 
But in our triumphs we shan't forget
Our comrades brave who fell
Some sleep today in nameless graves
But soon their deeds will tell
In grateful Ireland brave and free
We'll have their names displayed
In good old Cork, in famed West Cork
The Third West Cork Brigade

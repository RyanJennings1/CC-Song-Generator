Laws were made for people and the law can never scorn
The right of a man to be free

Free the people, let them have their say
Free the people, let them see the light of day

Addys Madden was breaking when they took her man away
Not knowing what was his crime
Just what he was guilty of not one of them could say
But they think of something in time
He says "Goodbye and remember, we shall overcome"

Free the people, let them have their say
Free the people, let them see the light of day

Comforting her children softly crying in the night
She tries very hard to explain
"You know your daddy never did a thing that wasn't right
So soon he's bound to be home again
He is a good man and he shall overcome"

Free the people, let them have their say
Free the people, let them see the light of day

But does is profit him, the right to be born
If he suffers the loss of liberty
Laws were made for people and the law can never scorn
The right of a man to be free
We are the people and we shall overcome
We are the people and we shall overcome

Free the people, let them have their say
Free the people, let them see the light of day

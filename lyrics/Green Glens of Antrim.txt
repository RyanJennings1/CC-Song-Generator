Far across yonder blue lies a true fairy land
With the sea rippling over the shingle and sand
Where the gay honeysuckle is luring the bee
And the green glens of Antrim are calling to me

If only you knew how the lamp of the moon
Turns a blue irish bay to a silver lagoon
You'd imagine the picture of heaven it would be
Where the green glens of Antrim are calling to me

Soon I hope to return to my own Cushendall
'Tis the one place for me that can outshine them all
Sure I know ev'ry rock I recall every tree
Where the green glens of Antrim are welcoming me

I'd be where the people are simple and kind
And there's one there for me who's been aye on my mind
And I'd pray that the world would in peace let me be
Where the green glens of antrim are heaven to me
Where the green glens of antrim are heaven to me

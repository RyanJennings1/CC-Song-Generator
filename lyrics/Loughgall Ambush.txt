We've sung so many songs of fallen heroes
I really thought that I had said it all
But if a song can fill our hearts and raise our spirits,
Then I'll sing about our martyrs at Loughgall,
the Irish nation bowed its head in sorrow
Such sadness as this country's seldom known
For Monaghan has lost a gallant soldier
With seven Volunteers from green Tyrone

Oh England do you really think its over
If you do you're going to have to kill us all
For until you take your murderers out of Ireland,
Then we will make them rue the blood spill at Loughgall,

It was on a warm and misty Friday evening
The scent of apple blossom filled the air
That village street seemed quiet and deserted,
But hidden eyes were watching everywhere,
The digger bomb had only reached its target
The trap was sprung and gunfire filled the air
The SAS did not want any prisoners,
"Shoot to kill!" their orders were quite clear

They butchered eight brave volunteers that evening
They were kicked and punched in case they were not dead
They dragged them  up and down that Armagh village,
And filled their bodies full of British lead,
Did you think that it would teach us all a lesson
As such savagery the whole world was appalled
Don't you know that there's twenty more men waiting,
For everyone you butchered at Loughgall

Farewell Paddy Kelly and Jim Lynagh
No more you'll lead your fighting unit forth
Side by side with PÃ¡draig McKearney and Tony Gormaley
You died to drive the British from the north
Declan Arthurs and the youthful Seamus Donnelly
On that night you were the youngest of them all
With Gerry O'Callaghan and the gallant Eugene Kelly
Oh your blood still stains the pavements at Loughgall

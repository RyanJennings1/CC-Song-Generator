So fare thee well, my own true love
I'll think of you night and day

Farewell to old Ireland
Good-bye to you, Bannastrant
No time to look back
Facing the wind, fighting the waves
May heaven protect us all
From cold, hunger and angry squalls
Pray I won't be lost
Wind in the sails, carry me safe

Chorus:
So fare thee well, my own true love
I'll think of you night and day
A place in my mind you will surely find
Although I am so far away
And when I'm alone far away from home
I'll think of the good times once more
Until I can make it back someday here
To Paddy's green shamrock shore

Out now on the ocean deep
Ship's noise makes it hard to sleep
Tears fill up my eyes
The image of you won't go away

So fare thee well, my own true love
I'll think of you night and day
A place in my mind you will surely find
Although I am so far away
And when I'm alone far away from home
I'll think of the good times once more
Until I can make it back someday here
To Paddy's green shamrock shore

New York is in sight at last
My heart, it is pounding fast
Trying to be brave
Wishing you near
By my side, a stor

So fare thee well, my own true love
I'll think of you night and day
A place in my mind you will surely find
Although I am so far away
And when I'm alone far away from home
I'll think of the good times once more
Until I can make it back someday here
To Paddy's green shamrock shore

Until I can make it back someday here
To Paddy's green shamrock shore

Down by the Salley Gardens my love and I did meet
She passed the Salley Gardens with little snow white feet
She bid me to take love easy, as the leaves grow on the trees
But I, being young and foolish, with her did not agree

In a field by the river, my love and I did stand
And on my leaning shoulder she placed her snow white hand
She bid me to take life easy, as the grass grows on the weir
But I was young and foolish, and now am full of tears

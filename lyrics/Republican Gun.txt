And I would dream of how proud they felt back in "16" 
Still remember the fright when the UDA came in the middle of the night 
Right then I knew that I was destined to throw every brick that I threw 

If you listen you can hear....the sound of the drums 
But as long as they're here...you'll hear Republican Guns 

How many years, must the English bathe in Irish tears 
How many must die, as the coffins pass the mothers cry 
The day will come, when the children never hear the sound of a drum 
The day will come, when the children never fear the sound of a gun 

If you listen you can hear....the sound of the drums 
But as long as they're here...you'll hear Republican Guns 

Was it your son, among the strikers who died back in "81" 
And how would you feel, if it was your father that the soldiers had killed 
If it was, you would gladly give your life to the cause 
With your last breath you'd shout 
Peace will never come until the English are out!

If you listen you can hear....the sound of the drums 
But as long as they're here...you'll hear Republican Guns

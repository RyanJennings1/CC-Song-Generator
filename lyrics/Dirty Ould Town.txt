I met my love in a gas works croft
dreamed a dream, by the old canal
kissed my girl by the fac'try wall
dirty ould town, dirty ould town

I saw the clouds drift across the moon
cats are crawling, all along the beat
springs a girl to the streets at night
dirty ould town, dirty ould town

I heard a siren, down by the docks
saw a train, set the night on fire
I smelled the spring on a smokey breeze
dirty ould town, dirty ould town

I'm gonna get me, a good sharp ax
shinin' steel tempered in a fire
we'll chop you down, like a dead ould tree
dirty ould town, dirty ould town

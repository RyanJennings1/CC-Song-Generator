Farewell to  Bellaghy, likewise Tamlaghtduff,
And the green hills of Derry that I dearly love,
My thoughts return to you from my dark H-Block cell,
So friends and brave comrades, I bid you farewell

For hundreds of years now we've kept up the fight
and the history books told us of Ireland's plight
so with gallant Francis I followed the call
To conquer the tyrants and defy England's laws. 

Farewell to  Bellaghy, likewise Tamlaghtduff,
And the green hills of Derry that I dearly love,
My thoughts return to you from my dark H-Block cell,
So friends and brave comrades, I bid you farewell

Through the hills of south Derry we marched and we drilled,
To our exploits in action all Irish youth thrilled,
The most feared men in Ulster, volunteers on the run,
We give England our answer from the barrels of our guns.

Farewell to  Bellaghy, likewise Tamlaghtduff,
And the green hills of Derry that I dearly love,
My thoughts return to you from my dark H-Block cell,
So friends and brave comrades, I bid you farewell

Oh gallant south Derry you are forever blessed,
In the struggle for freedom you have given your best,
There's Hughes and there's Bateson, Sheridan and Leigh,
And inscribed with their names now brave Tom McElwee

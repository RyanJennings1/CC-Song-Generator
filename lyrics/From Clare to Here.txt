Well there's four of us who share the room, we work hard for the brass
And getting up late on Sunday, I never go to mass

It's a long long way from Clare to here
It's a long long way from Clare to here
Oh, it's a long long way, it gets further day by day
It's a long long way from Clare to here

When Friday night comes around and Eddy's only in the fighting
My ma would like a letter home but I'm too tired for writing

It's a long long way from Clare to here
It's a long long way from Clare to here
Oh, it's a long long way, it gets further day by day
It's a long long way from Clare to here

Well it almost breaks my heart when I think of Josephine
I promised I'd be coming back with pockets full of green

It's a long long way from Clare to here
It's a long long way from Clare to here
Oh, it's a long long way, it gets further day by day
It's a long long way from Clare to here

I dream I hear a piper play maybe it's emotion
I dream I see white horses dance on that other ocean

It's a long long way from Clare to here
It's a long long way from Clare to here
Oh, it's a long long way, it gets further day by day
It's a long long way from Clare to here

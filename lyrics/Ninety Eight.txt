Still forms, grey dust, black stones in Dublin city, 
A grave in green Kildare, 
And many a grassy mound that moves our pity 
O'er Erin everywhere; 

Cave Hill above the Lagan's noises rearing 
Her shaggy head in pride; 
Lone Ednavady's brow and Antrim staring 
Across Lough Neagh's rough tide; 

Killala still her weary watch maintaining 
Beside the ocean's boom, 
And Castlebar in faithful guard remaining 
Around the Frenchmen's tomb. 

Ross, Wexford, Gorey, Oulart, Tubberneering, 
And many a Wicklow glen 
That knew the dauntless souls and hearts unfearing 
Of Dwyer and all his men 

These, through a hundred years of gloom and doubting 
Speak trumpet-toned to-day, 
Above the cry of creed and faction's shouting 
To tread the olden way. 

These, in the hearts of all the true men, waken 
The olden fires anew; 
These tell of hope unquenched and faith unshaken, 
Of something still to do. 

They bring us visions, full of tears and sorrow, 
Of homes and hearts left lone; 
Of eyes grown dim with watching for a morrow 
Of joy that never shone. 

But, too, they whisper notes of preparation 
And strength beyond the seas, 
Of hope outliving night and desolation 
Through all the centuries. 

Then to the staff-head let our flag ascending, 
Our fires on every hill 
Tell to the nations of the earth attending 
We wage the battle still 

Tell to the nations, though the grass is o'er them, 
For many a weary year, 
Our fathers' souls still thrill the land that bore them, 
Their spirit still is there. 

And by their graves we swear this year of story 
To battle side by side, 
Till Freedom crowns with immemorial glory 
The Cause for which they died.

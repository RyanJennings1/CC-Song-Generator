I just stepped in to see you all, I'll only stay a while
I want to see who you're gettin' on, I want to see your smile
I'm happy to be here again, I 've missed you one and all
there's no place in the world just like, the Homes of Donegal

I long to see your happy faces, smiling at your door
the kettle singin' on the crook, as I walk across your floor
and soon that teapot's fillin' up, my cup, it's far from small
your hearts are like your mountains in the Homes of Donegal

I long to spend a while with you, to bide away the night
with tales of yore and fairy lore beside your fireside bright
and then I see prepared for me, a shakedown by the wall
there's repose for weary wanderers in the Homes of Donegal

The time has come when I must go, I'll bid you all adieu
the open highway calls to me to do the things I do
and when I'm wandering far way I'll hear your voices call
and please God I'll soon return unto the Homes of Donegal

Well, if you've got a wing-o, take her up to Ring-o
Where the waxies sing-o all the day;
If you've had your fill of porter, and you can't go any further
Give your man the order: "Back to the Quay!"

And take her up to Monto, Monto, Monto
Take her up to Monto, lan-ge- roo,
To you!

You've heard of the Duke of Gloucester, the dirty old imposter
He got a mot and lost her, up the Furry Glen.
He first put on his bowler and he buttoned up his trousers,
And he whistled for a growler and he says, "My man"

And take her up to Monto, Monto, Monto
Take her up to Monto, lan-ge- roo,
To you!

You've heard of the Dublin Fusileers, the dirty old bamboozileers,
They went and got the childer, one, two, three.
Oh, marching from the Linen Hall there's one for every cannonball,
And Vick's going to send them all, o'er the sea.
But first go up to

And take her up to Monto, Monto, Monto
Take her up to Monto, lan-ge- roo,
To you!

When Carey told on Skin-the-goat, O'Donnell caught him on the boat
He wished he'd never been afloat, the filthy skite.
It wasn't very sensible to tell on the Invincibles]
They stood up for their principles, day and night.
And they all went up to

And take her up to Monto, Monto, Monto
Take her up to Monto, lan-ge- roo,
To you!

Now when the Czar of Russia and the King of Prussia
Landed in the Phoenix Park in a big balloon,
They asked the polismen to play "The Wearin' of the Green"
But the buggers in the depot didn't know the tune.
So they both went up to

And take her up to Monto, Monto, Monto
Take her up to Monto, lan-ge- roo,
To you!

Now the Queen she came to call on us, she wanted to see all of us
I'm glad she didn't fall on us, she's eighteen stone.
"Mister Melord the Mayor," says she, "Is this all you've got to
show me?"
"Why, no ma'am there's some more to see, Pog mo thoin!"
And he took her up

And take her up to Monto, Monto, Monto
Take her up to Monto, lan-ge- roo,
To you!

When first I saw the love-light in your eyes
I dreamed the world held not but joy for me
And even though we drifted far apart
I never dream but what I dream of thee

I love you as I never loved before
Since first I met you on the village green
Come to me or my dream of love is or
I love you as I loved you, when you were sweet
When you were sweet sixteen

I love you as I never loved before
Since first I met you on the village green
Come to me or my dream of love is or ...
I love you as I loved you, when you were sweet
When you were sweet sixteen

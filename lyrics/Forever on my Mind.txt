Darkened years of winter have passed 
Summer waits for spring before it lives 
Blanket clad and wasted the winter has been long 
No gleam of hope a thoughtless nation gives 
In silence we walked through the streets 
As one by one our hungerstrikers died.

Their memory is forever in my mind 
Pictures of their faces in my eyes 
My sorrow and grief will not subside 
And my love for them I will not diguise 
In silence we walked through the streets 
As one by one our hungerstrikers died.

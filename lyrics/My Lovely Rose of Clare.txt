Oh the sun it shines out like a jewel
on the lovely hills of Clare
as I walked along with my sweet love
one evening at the fair
her eyes they shone like silver streams
her long and golden hair
and I have won the heart of one
my Lovely Rose of Clare

Oh My Lovely Rose of Clare
you're the sweetest girl I know
the queen of all the roses
and the pretty flowers that grow
you are the sunshine of my life
so beautiful and fair
and I will always love you
my lovely rose of Clare

As we walked down by the riverbank
watched the Shannon flowing by
and listening to the nightingale
sing songs for you and I
and to bid farewell
to all so true and fair
for I have won the heart of one
my Lovely Rose of Clare

Oh My Lovely Rose of Clare
you're the sweetest girl I know
the queen of all the roses
and the pretty flowers that grow
you are the sunshine of my life
so beautiful and fair
and I will always love you
my lovely rose of Clare

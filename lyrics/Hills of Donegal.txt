Oh Donegal the pride of all my heart
still turns to thee in me cottage home
where oft I did roam when I was young and free
Big houses ground on foreign
land they can't compare t'all with me
cottage bright on a winter's night
in the hills of Donegal Right well
I mind in the harvest time a doleful dreary day
when leaving all in Donegal I wandered far away
In creshla town my friends stood 'round
I bid farewell to all
and I waved my hand to my own dear land
and the hills of Donegal
When gazing back trough Botners Gap
but my own native hills again
I thought no shame for who could blame
'twas there I cried my fill
My parents kind ran in my mind
my friends and comrades
all but I heard a sigh
and I waved goodbye to the hills of Donegal
Oh gragh machree I longed to see
my own native hills again
on a foreign shore my heart is sore
with exile longing pain could I but see
those mountains free
'twould compensate for all & I'd live
as my poor fathers lived in the hills of Donegal

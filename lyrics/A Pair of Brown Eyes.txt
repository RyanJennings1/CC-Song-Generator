One summer evening drunk to hell 
I sat there nearly lifeless 
An old man in the corner sang 
Where the water lilies grow 
And on the jukebox Johnny sang 
About a thing called love 
And it's how are you kid and what's your name 
And how would you bloody know 

In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky 
I lay down on the ground 
And the arms and legs of other men 
Were scattered all around 
Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed 
Then prayed then bled some more 

And the only thing that I could see 
Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me 
But when we got back, labelled parts one to three 
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me 

And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go 
For a pair of brown eyes 

I looked at him he looked at me 
All I could do was hate him 
While Ray and Philomena sang 
Of my elusive dreams 
I saw the streams, the rolling hills 
Where his brown eyes were waiting 
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes 
That waited once for me 

So drunk to hell I left the place 
Sometimes crawling sometimes walking 
A hungry sound came across the breeze 
So I gave the walls a talking 
And I heard the sounds of long ago 
From the old canal 
And the birds were whistling in the trees 
Where the wind was gently laughing 

So a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go 
For a pair of brown eyes 
For a pair of brown eyes

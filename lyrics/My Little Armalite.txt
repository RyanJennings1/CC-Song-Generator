And it’s down along the Falls Road is where I long to be
Lying in the dark with a provo company
A comrade on me left and another one on me right
A clip of ammunition for me little Armalite

I was stopped by a soldier, he said “You are a swine”
He hit me with his rifle and he kicked me in the groin
I begged and i pleaded, all my manners were polite
But all the time I’m thinking of me little Armalite

And it’s down in the Bogside is where I long to be
Lying in the dark with a provo company
A comrade on me left and another one on me right
A clip of ammunition for me little Armalite

Well this brave RUC man came marching up our street
Six hundred British soldiers he had lined up at his feet
“Come out you cowardly fenians, come on out and fight”
He cried “I’m only joking” when he heard the Armalite

And it’s down in Bellaghy is where I long to be
Lying in the dark with a provo company
A comrade on me left and another one on me right
A clip of ammunition for me little Armalite

Well the army came to visit me, it was in the early hours
With Saracens and Saladins and Ferret armoured cars
They thought they had me cornered, but I gave them all a fright
With the armour piercing bullets of me little Armalite

And it’s down in the New Lodge is where I long to be
Lying in the dark with a provo company
A comrade on me left and another one on me right
A clip of ammunition for me little Armalite

Well when Pryor came to Belfast to see the battles won
The generals they had told him “We’ve got them on the run”
But corporals and privates while on patrol at night
Say “Remember Narrow Water and the bloody Armalite”

And it’s down in Crossmaglen is where I long to be
Lying in the dark with a provo company
A comrade on me left and another one on me right
A clip of ammunition for me little Armalite

it was a morning in July, I was walking through Tipperary
When I heard a battle cry from the mountains overhead
As I looked up in the sky I saw an Irish soldier laddie
He looked at me right fearlessly and said:

"Will you stand in the band like a true Irish man,
And go and fight the forces of the crown?
Will ye march with O'Neill to an Irish battle field?
For tonight we go to free old Wexford town!

Said I to that soldier lad,"Would you take me to your captain
it would be my pride and joy for to march with you today.
My young brother fell in Cork and my son at Enniscorthy!"
So to the noble captain I did say

"Will you stand in the band like a true Irish man,
And go and fight the forces of the crown?
Will ye march with O'Neill to an Irish battle field?
For tonight we go to free old Wexford town!

As we marched back from the field in the shadow of the evening
With our banners flying low to the memory of our dead
We returned unto our homes but without our soldier laddie
But I can't forget those brave words he said

"Will you stand in the band like a true Irish man,
And go and fight the forces of the crown?
Will ye march with O'Neill to an Irish battle field?
For tonight we go to free old Wexford town!

‘Twas a cold December day
A lorry ploughed its way
‘Midst bullets splash and play
On Ashtown Road

In that car a living tool
Of England’s hated rule
There was begun a duel
On Ashtown Road

Young Savage, unafraid
With gun and hand grenade
Attacked them undismayed
On Ashtown Road

But a bullet laid him low
From a rifle of the foe
That’s another debt we owe
For Ashtown Road

But another day shall dawn
Like that cold December morn
When a martyr’s name was born
On Ashtown Road.

We laid him in a grave
Where the willows sadly wave
Oh! son of Erin brave
Farewell to thee

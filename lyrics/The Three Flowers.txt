One time when walking down a lane 
As night was drawing nigh 
I met a colleen with three flowers 
And she more young than I 
"Saint Patrick bless you dear" I said 
"If you'll be quick to tell 
The place where you did find those flowers 
I seem to know them well" 

She took and kissed the first flower once 
And sweetly said to me 
"This flower comes from the Wicklow hills 
Dew wet and pure", said she 
"It's name is Michael Dwyer 
The strongest flower of all 
But I'll keep it fresh beside my breast 
Though all the world should fall" 

She took and kissed the first flower twice 
And sweetly said to me 
"This flower I culled in Antrim fields 
outside Belfast", said she 
"The name I call it is Wolfe Tone 
The bravest flower of all 
But I'll keep it fresh beside my breast 
Though all the world should fall" 

She took and kissed the first flower thrice 
And softly said to me 
"This flower I found in Thomas Street 
In Dublin fair", said she 
"Its name is Robert Emmet 
The youngest flower of all 
But I'll keep it fresh beside my breast 
Though all the world should fall 
Then Emmet,Dwyer and Tone I'll keep 
For I do love them all 
And I'll keep them fresh beside my breast 
Though all the world should fall"

‘Twas on a dreary New Year’s day as the shades of night came down
A lorry load of volunteers approached a Border town
They were men from Dublin and from Cork, Fermanagh and Tyrone
But the leader was a Limerick man, Sean South of Garryowen

And as they moved along the street up to the barrack door
They scorned the danger they would meet, the fate that lay in store
They were fighting for old Ireland’s cause, to claim our very own
And the foremost of that gallant band was South of Garryowen

But the sergeant foiled their daring plan, he spied them thro’ the door
Then the sten guns and the rifles, a hail of death did pour
And when that awful night was past, two men were cold as stone
There was one from near the Border and one from Garryowen

No more he’ll hear the seagull cry o’er the murmuring Shannon tide
For he fell beneath the Northern sky, brave Hanlon at his side
He has gone to join that gallant band of Plunkett, Pearse and Tone.
A martyr for old Ireland, Sean South of Garryowen

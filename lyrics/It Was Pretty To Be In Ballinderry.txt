'Twas pretty to be in Ballinderry
'Twas pretty to be in Aghalee
Still prettier to be on bonny Ram's Island
Sitting forever beneath a tree

For often I sailed to bonny Ram's Island
Arm in arm with Phelim, my diamond
And he would whistle and I would sing
And we would make the whole island ring

"I'm going," he said, "from bonny Ram's Island
Out and across the deep blue sea
And if in your heart you love me, Mary
Open your arms at last to me"

'Twas pretty to be in Ballinderry
But now it's as sad as sad can be
For the ship that sailed with Phelim, my diamond
Is sunk forever beneath the sea

'Twas pretty to be in Ballinderry
'Twas pretty to be in Aghalee
Still prettier to be on bonny Ram's Island
Sitting forever beneath a tree

'Twas early early all in the Spring
the birds did whistle and sweetly sing
changing their notes from tree to tree
and the song they sang was old Ireland Free

"twas early early all in the night
the yeoman cavalry gave me a freight
the yeoman cavalry was my downfall
and taken was I by Lord Cornwall

As I went walkin' up Wexford Hill
oh who would blame me to cry my fill
I looked behind and I looked before
my aged mother I shall see no more

As I went walkin' up Wexford Street
my own first cousin I chanced to meet
my own first cousin did me betray
and for one bare Guinnea sold my life away

As I was mounted on the platform high
my aged Father I chanced to spy
My aged Father did me deny
and the name he gave was the Croppy Boy

It's in Dungannon where this young man died
and in Dungannon where his body lies
so all good people who do pass by
do drop a tear for the Croppy Boy

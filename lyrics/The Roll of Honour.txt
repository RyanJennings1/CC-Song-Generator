Read the roll of honour for Ireland's bravest men 
We must be united in memory of the ten 
England you're a monster, don't think that you have won 
We will never be defeated while Ireland has such sons 

In those dreary H-Block cages ten brave young Irishmen lay 
Hungering for justice while their young lives ebbed away 
For their rights as Irish soldiers and to free their native land 
They stood beside their leader the gallant Bobby Sands 

Now they mourn Hughes in Bellaghy, Ray McCreish in Armagh's hill 
In those narrow streets of Derry they miss O'Hara still, 
They so proudly gave their young lives to break Britannia's hold 
Their names shall be remembered as history unfolds

We must be united in memory of the ten 
England you're a monster, don't think that you have won 
We will never be defeated while Ireland has such sons 

Through the war torn streets of Ulster the black flags did sadly wave 
To salute ten Irish martyrs, the bravest of the brave 
Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty 
They gave their lives for freedom with Thomas McElwee 

Michael Devine from Derry you were the last to die 
With your nine brave companions, with the martyred dead you lie 
Your souls cry out "Remember, our deaths are not in vain 
Fight on and make our homeland a nation once again"

England you're a monster, don't think that you have won 
We will never be defeated while Ireland has such sons

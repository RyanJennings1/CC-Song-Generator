Try to sing some songs of glory,
Sing some songs of peace,
But in the end it's the same old story,
They're both so hard to reach.
People tell me they're sick and they're tired,
Of seeing this place run down,
Well I say: "Take off those blindfolds, you hypocrites,
And help get us off the ground."

And please say it isn't so,
Why Willie and Danny had to go,
The reason's very clear,
They're laying down their lives for us year after year.

Seventy shots between their bodies,
Not one of those bullets missed,
But for every trigger pulled that morning,
A volunteer, he will enlist.

For five long hours they left them lying there,
The priest was turned away,
So another step lower for those SAS bastards,
We'll never forget that day.

And please say it isn't so,
Why Willie and Danny had to go,
The reason's very clear,
They're laying down their lives for us year after year.

Oh, the funerals were to prove their worthiness,
Thousands, they thronged the routes,
Just to watch the Borstel Boys they hovered helplessly overhead,
As the 'RA came out to salute.
Oh, they emptied their magazines over each coffin,
As defiantly the crowds were sent,
So another day dawns and the guns will be out again,
'Cause Willie and Danny had friends.

And please say it isn't so,
Why Willie and Danny had to go,
The reason's very clear,
They're laying down their lives for us year after year.

Please say it isn't so,
Why Willie and Danny, they had to go,
Yes, the reason's very clear,
They're laying down their lives for us year after year.

Please say it isn't so

Many young men of twenty said goodbye
All that long day
From break of dawn until the sun was high
Many young men of twenty said goodbye

My boy Jimmy went that day
On the big ship sailed away
Sailed away and left me here to die
Many young men of twenty said goodbye

I met my love upon the mountain Rim
The day he left
I knew I bore a living child of him
I knew I bore a living child of him

And the child was born to me
Jimmy's gone across the sea
Jimmy's gone and here alone am I
Many young men of twenty said goodbye

My Jimmy said he'd sail across the sea
He swore his oath
He'd sail back home one day and marry me
He'd sail back home one day and marry me

But my Jimmy let me down
Now they mock me in the town
Oh my Jimmy please come back to me
Oh my Jimmy please come back to me

Many young men of twenty said goodbye
All that long day
From break of dawn until the sun was high
Many young men of twenty said goodbye

They left the mountains and the glens
The lasses and the fine young men
I saw the tears of every girl and boy
Many young men of twenty said goodbye

I was walking down by Island bridge, just doing as I pleased
This April day the sun was warm, there was but a gentle breeze
I wandered up the old stone steps into Phoenix Park
To watch the children laugh and play in the hours before the dark

I strolled up by the monument and lay down on the ground
Then people started crying when they heard the battle sound
I don’t know what came over me, but for a moment I could hear
The echo of a soldier’s voice that kept calling in my ear

Meet me at the Pillar son, meet me there at noon
I need you brave young Irishmen, there is something we must do
Meet me at the Pillar son, still it’s not too late
It’s time to sing a Freedom’s song, come soon I cannot wait

I turned around to see this man, but nobody was there
In the distance I could hear the drums, yet a stillness filled the air
I closed my eyes and in my dreams a soldier I could see
He said his name was Pádraig Pearse, and he kept on calling me

That awful night I lay awake and many times I cried
I could not answer his commands, no matter how I tried
There in the dark I did my best to say a silent prayer
That when they take him to his fate, he’ll know how much I cared

Meet me at the Pillar son, meet me there at noon
I need you brave young Irishmen, there is something we must do
Meet me at the Pillar son, still it’s not too late
It’s time to sing a Freedom’s song, come soon I cannot wait

"And come tell me Sean O'Farrell, tell me why you hurry so"
"Hush, mbuachaill, hush and listen," and his cheeks were all aglow
"I bear orders from the captain, get you ready quick and soon
For the pikes must be together by the rising of the moon"

By the rising of the moon, by the rising of the moon
For the pikes must be together by the rising of the moon

"And come tell me Sean O'Farrell, where the gath'rin is to be"
"At the old spot by the river quite well known to you and me"
"One more word for signal token: whistle out the marchin' tune
With your pike upon your shoulder by the rising of the moon"

By the rising of the moon, by the rising of the moon
With your pike upon your shoulder by the rising of the moon

Out from many a mud wall cabin eyes were watching through the night
Many a manly heart was beating for the blessed warning light
Murmurs rang along the valleys to the banshee's lonely croon
And a thousand pikes were flashing by the rising of the moon

By the rising of the moon, by the rising of the moon
And a thousand pikes were flashing by the rising of the moon

All along that singing river that black mass of men was seen
High above their shining weapons flew their own beloved green
Death to every foe and traitor! Whistle out the marching tune
And hurrah, me boys, for freedom, 'tis the rising of the moon

Tis the rising of the moon, 'tis the rising of the moon
And hurrah, me boys, for freedom, 'tis the rising of the moon

Well they fought for poor old Ireland and full bitter was their fate
(Oh what glorious pride and sorrow fills the name of 98)
Yet thank god their hearts are still beating still in manhood's burning noon
Who would follow in their footsteps at the rising of the moon

At the rising of the moon, at the rising of the moon
Who would follow in their footsteps by the rising of the moon
By the rising of the moon, by the rising of the moon
And hurrah me boys, for freedom, 'tis the rising of the moon...

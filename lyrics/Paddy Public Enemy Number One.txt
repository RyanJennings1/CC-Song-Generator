The chasing girls was easy and drinking been was fun
And he went out one day and bought himself a gun,
He shot a couple of coppers and he joined the IRA,
And the papers called him Paddy Public Enemy No. 1

The Coppers in the north they couldn't catch him
The British army they just couldn't touch him
He shot a couple of coppers and he joined the IRA,
And the papers called him Paddy Public Enemy No. 1

One day the knock came at the door, they hauled him away,
The IRA they kicked him out when he was still in jail
When he got outta jail he shouted up the IRA
And the papers called him Paddy Public Enemy No. 1

The factions all were fighting
Their deadly power game
He said fuck them all and left the INLA
Wherever there was trouble
There was Paddy and his gun
And the papers called him Paddy Public Enemy No. 1

One day he tired of it all and hung away his gun
When he hung away his gun he became the hunted one
He went into a phone box to make a local call,
They shot him in the phonebox
Splashin blood upon the wall

But when he hung away his gun he became the hunted one
And that was the end of Paddy Public Enemy No 1.

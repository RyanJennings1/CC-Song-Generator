I was dreamin' of old Ireland and Killarneys lakes and dells
I was dreamin' of the shamrock, and the dear old Shandon Bells
When my reverie suggested in a vision bright and clear
All the strange things that would happen
If we had old Ireland here

If the Blarney stone stood out on Sidney Harbour
And Dublin Town in Melbourne came to stay
If the Shannon River joined the Brisbane Waters
And Killarneys lakes flowed into Botany Bay
If the Shandons Bells rang out in old Fremantle
And County Cork in Adelaide did appear
Erin's sons would never roam, all the boys would stay at home
If we only had old Ireland over here

There were lots of lovely fairies dancing on the village green
There were lots of lovely coleens, the finest ever seen
And the boys were all called Paddy
And the girls called Molly Dear
Sure we'd wrap the green flag round them
If we had old Ireland here

If the Blarney Stone stood out on Sidney Harbour
And Dublin Town in Melbourne came to stay
If the Shannon River joined the Brisbane Waters
And Killarneys lakes flowed into Botany Bay
If the Shandons Bells rang out in Old Fremantle
And County Cork in Adelaide did appear
Erin's sons would never roam, all the boys would stay at home
If we only had old Ireland over here
If we only had old Ireland over here

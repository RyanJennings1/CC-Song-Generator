Its of a brave young Volunteer this story I'll relate
Who saved the lives of many but in Dublin met his fate
At the hands of brutal cowards who came to maim and kill
But they met with Martin Doherty and by God they're running [Em]still.
 
For Doherty was there
Doherty was there
Young, strong, courageous
Martin Doherty was there.
 
Now Martin was a veteran of service long and hard
His post that night in Pearse Street Widow Scallan's pub to guard
He belonged to our old Dublin Brigade with it's valiant history
But none was ever braver than young "Doco" Doherty.
 
For Doherty was there
Doherty was there
Young, strong, courageous
Martin Doherty was there.
 
"Twas on that night in Pearse Street a concert it was held
To aid our Irish prisoners locked up in British cells
In the hall above the band did play and dancers fought the floor
While down below was Martin with his eye upon the door
 
For Doherty was there
Doherty was there
Young, strong, courageous
Martin Doherty was there.
 
Now Martin spied the UVF come skulking through the night
He quickly stepped out to the street and boldly he did fight
They'd a mighty bomb of Semtex and pistols in their hands
But they thought they'd met the Devil when Doherty made his stand.
 
For Doherty was there
Doherty was there
Young, strong, courageous
Martin Doherty was there.
 
Those cowards left their bomb unprimed, their only thought was flight
They learned that bad town Dublin was no place for them that night
They basely fled one Volunteer with no wepons in his hand
But with their guns they slaughtered Martin Doherty as they ran.
 
For Doherty was there
Doherty was there
Young, strong, courageous
Martin Doherty was there.
 
The useless cops, late on the scene, viewed Martin lying low
They sniggered and the chuckled "There's one less Provo now"
But the people from the hall above they spoke up loud and clear
"Ye Blueshirt hoors, we'd all be dead but for that Volunteer!'
 
For Doherty was there
Doherty was there
Young, strong, courageous
Martin Doherty was there.
 
His funeral, seen round the world, it showed Britannia clear
That though they try to kill us they instill in us no fear
For thousands lined the streets that day to bid a last farewell
To this young man from Dublin town who lived and died so well.
 
For Doherty was there
Doherty was there
Young, strong, courageous
Martin Doherty was there.

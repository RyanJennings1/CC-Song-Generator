I've been the wild rover for manys a year
and I spent all my money on whiskey and beer
and now I'm returning with gold in great score
and I never will play the wild rover no more

And it's no nay never
no nay never no more
will I play the wild rover
No never no more

I went into an ale house I used to frequent
and I told the landlady my money was spent
I asked her for credit she answered me nay
such a custom as your I can get any day

And it's no nay never
no nay never no more
will I play the wild rover
No never no more

Then out of my pockets I took sovereigns bright
and my landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
She said, "I have whiskey and wines of the best!"
but the answer I gave her was only in jest

And it's no nay never
no nay never no more
will I play the wild rover
No never no more

I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
and I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
and if they caress my as oft times before
than I never will play the wild rover no more

And it's no nay never
no nay never no more
will I play the wild rover
No never no more

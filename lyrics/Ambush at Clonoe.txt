Here's a song of young lives lost before their time,
Of four daring lads cut down in their prime,
In a land that longs for freedom and for peace,
It's a prayer that all the heartache soon might cease.

Sometimes it is hard to find the words to say,
When it cuts so deep the pain won't go away,
How much longer must we struggle, mourn, and pray,
Until we see the light of freedoms dawning day?

In their boyhood years these lads learned at first hand,
They were only second class in their own land,
Stopped and searched by police each time they walked the streets,
And degraded by each foot patrol they'd meet,

To the ruc and soldiers it was fun,
To intimidate our children with their guns,
But there's some young folk will not take [Em]anymore,
And there's some that want to even up the score.

Barry o'donnell was a thorn in england's side,
And he led his volunteers with dauntless pride,
Sean o'farrell stood beside him all the while,
And we will never will forget his roguish smile,

Countless times in action these pair played their part,
That they couldn't hold them broke the soldiers heart,
But those two knew they lived on borrowed time,
But they'd make their mark, before they walked the line.
In coalisland square that february night,
Oh! The soldiers in the barracks all took fright,
For on a lorry coming straight ahead,
Was a unit of the east tyrone brigade,
From that lorry's back the irish flag flew high,
And that big machine gun pointed to the sky,
And when barry with that big gun, began to shoot,
How those soldiers longed for transfers to beirut.
As a tracer bullet split the barracks wall,
Those brave volunteers they showed no fear at all,
As the lorry drove away the people cheered,
Little knowing that their cries would soon be tears,
It was the boldest deed that little town had known,
In all the years of struggle in tyrone,
But it was the saddest night the town will come to know,
For the sas were waiting at clonoe.
It was not until they had the big gun down,
And the volunteers thought they were safe and sound,
That the sas they opened up on every side,
And in that killing field four brave men died,
We lost bold peter clancy on that night,
A volunteer who scorned britania's might,
Young paddy vincent died there at his side,
He lost his life for what he thought was right.
We salute barry, peter, paddy, sean,
Though you've left us still your memory will live on,
For you the crown a knee you'd never bend,
And you were bold and fearless to the end,
So come all of you that love your native land,
As for peace and freedom we march hand in hand,
Our four volunteers have not been lost in vain,
From the ashes we can build our land again.

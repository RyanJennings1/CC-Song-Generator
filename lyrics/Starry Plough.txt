Rise up the starry plough in James Connolly's name
Rise up the starry plough for his glory and his fame
He joined the transport union , so workers could be free
He fought for Irish freedom, for the likes of you and me

James Connolly came from Scotland , a rebel to the core
He wanted not just freedom , but socialism and more
He said when we gain our freedom , from England's cruel hands
We'll have to fight the bankers , we'll have to make a stand

Rise up the starry plough in James Connolly's name
Rise up the starry plough for his glory and his fame
He joined the transport union , so workers could be free
He fought for Irish freedom, for the likes of you and me

He held his life for liberty in the GPO
He held his life for freedom , and he would not let it go
Well the Brits, they bombarded them and they smashed them brick by brick
He held his life for freedom, and the socialist republic

Rise up the starry plough in James Connolly's name
Rise up the starry plough for his glory and his fame
He joined the transport union , so workers could be free
He fought for Irish freedom, for the likes of you and me

Connolly is a hero , and they shot him in a chair
They took him from the hospital, and those who were there
Well they set his lips on fire, on that Easter morn
As the bullet pierced his heart, an Irish martyr was born

What will his legacy be, now in this land of mine
Where nothing has a reason, and little has a rhyme
We fought the yeos in Wexford , we drove out the Black and Tans
Now we fight the bankers, and their greasy hands

Rise up the starry plough in James Connolly's name
Rise up the starry plough for his glory and his fame
He joined the transport union , so workers could be free
He fought for Irish freedom, for the likes of you and me

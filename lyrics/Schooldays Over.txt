School day's over come on then john,
Time to be getting your pit bootson
On with your sark andmoleskintrousers
time you were on yourway
time you were learning thepit man's job
Andearning the pit man'spay

Come on then jim it's time to go
Time you were working down below
Time to be handling a pick and shovel

you start at the pits today
Time you were learning the collier's job
And earning the colliers pay

Come on then dai, it's almost light
Time you were off to the anthracite
The morning mist is on the vally
It's time you were on your way
Time you were learning the miners job
And earning the miners pay

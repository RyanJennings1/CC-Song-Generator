I'm Looking Over A Four Leaf Clover 
I'm looking over a four leaf clover
That I over-looked before.
One leaf is sunshine, the second is rain,
Third is the roses that grows in the lane.
No need explaining the one remaining
Is somebody I adore.
I'm looking over a four leaf clover
That I over-looked before!

When they heard the call of a cause laid low
They sprang to their guns again,
And the pride of all was the first to fall,
The Glory of our fighting men.
In the days to come, when the pip and drum
You follow in the ways that they knew
When their praise you sin, let the echoes ring
With the memory of Cathal Brugha
 
Brave Liam Lynch on the mountainside
Felll a victim to the foe
And Danny Lacey for Ireland died
in the Glen of Aherlow
Neil Boyle and Quinn fromt the North came down
To stand with the faithful and true
And we'll sing their praise in the freedom days
'Mong the heroes of 22
 
Some fell in the proud red rush of war
And some by the treacherous blow,
Like the martyrs four in Dublin Town,
And the their comrades at Dromboe
And a hundred more in the barrack squares
and by lonely roadsides too
Without fear they died and we speak with pride
of the martyrs of 22
 
They were true to our right, they fought the good fight
and they rest in the peace of God
Lift up your hearts, O brave young men,
And march in the ways they trod.
The cause still calls that called to them
And the task will be only through
When freedom comes to the land we love
By the soldiers of 22.

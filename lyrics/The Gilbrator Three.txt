Sad are three homes in Belfast now
All Ireland she shares their sorrow
Mairead Farrel, Sean Savage and Daniel McCann
They died on the streets of Gibraltar

They Flew out of Belfast With an ambitious plan
To continue the struggle To free Ireland
Mairead Farrel, Sean Savage and Daniel McCann
They died on the streets of Gibraltar

Sad are three homes in Belfast now
All Ireland she shares their sorrow
As they walked in the sun the Brits drew their guns
And blood stained the streets of  Gibralta

The S.A.S. stood there so proud of their deed
Three more Freedom Fighters lay dead in the street
They'd been given no warning no chance to retreat
For three had to die in Gibraltar

And sad are three homes in Belfast now
All Ireland she shares their sorrow
As they walked in the sun the Brits drew their guns
And blood stained the streets of Gibralta

The S.A.S. stood there so proud of their deed
Three more Freedom Fighters lay dead in the street
They'd been given no warning no chance to retreat
For three had to die in Gibralta

And sad are three homes in Belfast now
All Ireland she shares their sorrow
As they walked in the sun the Brits drew their guns
And blood stained the streets of Gibraltar
Sad are three homes in Belfast now
All Ireland she shares their sorrow
Mairead Farrel, Sean Savage and Daniel McCann
They died on the streets of Gibraltar
And blood stained the streets of Gibraltar

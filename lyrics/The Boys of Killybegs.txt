There are wild and rocky hills, on the coast of Donegal.
And their fishermen are hardy brave and free.
And the big atlantic swell, is a thing they know right well,
As they fight to take a living from the sea.

With the pleasant rolling sea, and the herring running free,
And the fleet all riding gently through the foam.
When the boats are loaded down, there'll be singing in the town,
When the boys of Killybegs come rolling home.

Now you don your rubber boots, and you've got your oilskins on,
And you check the gear to see that it's O.K.
And your jumper keeps you warm, because its cold before the dawn,
And your ready to begin another day.

With the pleasant rolling sea, and the herring running free,
And the fleet all riding gently through the foam.
When the boats are loaded down, there'll be singing in the town,
When the boys of Killybegs come rolling home.

Well your headed out to sea, and the wind is blowing free,
And you cast your nets as rain bgins to fall.
But the sun comes riding through, and the clouds will soon roll by,
And tonight we'll maybe take a bumper haul.

With the pleasant rolling sea, and the herring running free,
And the fleet all riding gently through the foam.
When the boats are loaded down, there'll be singing in the town,
When the boys of Killybegs come rolling home.

Sure there's purple on the hill, but the stream's down by the shore,
And the sun has cast its gold upon the sea.
And there's silver down below, where the herring fishes go,
When we catch them, there'll be gold for you and me.

With the pleasant rolling sea, and the herring running free,
And the fleet all riding gently through the foam.
When the boats are loaded down, there'll be singing in the town,
When the boys of Killybegs come rolling home.

When the boats are loaded down, there'll be singing in the town,
When the boys of Killybegs come rolling home.

I remember the day it stands clear in my mind
We went down to Dun Laoighaire to wave you goodbye
Your ma was quietly weeping, there was a tear in my eye
your sailing to Gallipoli to die

You looked so young as you stood there with a glint in your eye
and you sang rebel songs as the streamers flew high
Your ma she turned away and I heard her sigh
you are sailing to Gallipoli to die

You were all that we had, your mammy and me
when you marched head erect you were proud as could be
but it killed your poor ma and it slowly killing me
when you were blown to kingdom come on the shores of Gallipoli

We got only one letter we knew right away
It said deepest regrets your son was bold and he was brave
you were only 19 yet your mammy and I let you sail to Gallipoli to die

You were all that we had, your mammy and me
when you marched head erect you were proud as could be
but it killed your poor ma and it slowly killing me
when you were blown to kingdom come on the shores of Gallipoli

You fought for the wrong country you fought for the wrong cause
and your ma often said that it was Ireland's great loss
all those fine young men who marched to foreign shores to fight the war
when the greatest war of all was at home

You were all that we had, your mammy and me
when you marched head erect you were proud as could be
but it killed your poor ma and it slowly killing me
when you were blown to kingdom come on the shores of Gallipoli

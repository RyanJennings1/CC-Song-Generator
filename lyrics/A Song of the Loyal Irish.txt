Boys, O Boys! Listen here to me, 
We´re going to live in a State that´s Free, 
Good English citizens all we´ll be; 
And friends of the Princess Royal; 
If we only flop on our hands and knees 
And swear by George of the lands and seas 
To wipe the green from the Irish trees 
And for evermore be loyal. 

We´ll welcome George with a slavish smile 
We´ll greet him in real colonial style, 
Back out of his presence half a mile, 
Like English Whigs and Tories; 
We´ll damn the deeds of the true and brave 
Who are sleeping in many an Irish grave 
Bow down like beggars and humbly crave 
For a share in England´s glories. 

We´ll curse the name of the rebel Tone, 
And of every rebel our land has known 
And all who hated the English throne, 
And fought for the Irish Nation, 
We´ve torn up every oath and vow, 
We´re part of the civilised Empire now, 
And the annals of England will teach us how 
To make sure of our soul´s salvation! 

All hail the glorious Union Jack! 
(Though steeped in the blood of the white and the black) 
We´ll paste it to Ireland´s bended back 
To prove to the world she´s loyal; 
We´ll stifle her voice, we´ll drown her cries, 
We´ll blacken her face with loyal lies, 
Throw royal dust in her angry eyes 
And hooray for George the Royal!

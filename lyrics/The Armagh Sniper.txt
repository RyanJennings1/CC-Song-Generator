In South Armagh there was a man who had a long ranged gun
He said "I'll show them army boys there's nowhere they can run"
He was the South Armagh sniper
He'd pick a spot and wait the whole day through
Until a Brit patrol came into view
The Armagh sniper he never missed his mark
He was lethal in the daytime and deadly in the dark
If he gets you in his sights you'd better say your prayers
So British troops go home or else beware
 
Soon his reputation spread through Ulster like wildfire
The list of British casualties just kept on getting higher
It was the South Armagh sniper
He made the British forces think again
Of wandering at night through Crossmaglen
The Armagh sniper the Brits were terrified
They could never pin him down no matter how they tried
If he gets you in his sights he'll make widows of your wives
So Brits go home while you still have your lives
 
Now in London and in Dublin they pretend to speak of peace
They say give us your guns and we shall make this bloodshed cease
But the South Armagh sniper
He's heard their lies and double talk before
He won't be fooled or cheated anymore
The Armagh sniper he hasn't gone away
His rifles always loaded he's just waiting for the day
So if the British forces should break their word well then
The sniper will go back to work again

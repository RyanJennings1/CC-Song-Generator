When all beside a vigil keep
the West's asleep, the West's asleep
alsas and well may Erin weep
when Connacht lies in slumber deep
there lake and plain smile fair and free
mid rocks their guardian chivalry sing
oh let man learn liberty
from crashing winds and lashing sea

That chainess wave and lovely land
Freedom and Nationhood demand
be sure the great God never planned
for slumbering slaves a home so grand
and long a brave and haughty race
honored and sentinelled the place
Sing Oh, not even their son's disgrace
can quite destroy their glory's trace

For often in O'Connor's van
to triumph dashed each Connacht clan
and fleet as deer the Normans ran
through Corrsliabh Pass and Ardrahan
and later times saw deeds as brave
and glory guards Clanricard's grave
Sing Oh they died their land to save
at Aughrim's slopes and Shannon's waves

And if, when all a vigil keep
The West's asleep! The West's asleep!
Alas! And well may Erin weep
That Connacht lies in slumber deep
But, hark! A voice like thunder spake
The West's awake! The West's awake!
Sing, Oh! Hurrah! Let England quake!
We'll fight till death for Ireland's sake

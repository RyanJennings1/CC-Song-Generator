well it's All For Me Grog me jolly jolly grog
all for me beer and tobacco
well I spent all me tin on the ladies drinkin gin
across the western ocean I will wander

Well it's all for me boots me noggin noggin boots
gone for me beer and tobacco
well the heels are worn ot
and the toes are kicked about
and the sole is lookin out for better weather

well it's All For Me Grog me jolly jolly grog
all for me beer and tobacco
well I spent all me tin on the ladies drinkin gin
across the western ocean I will wander

well it's all for me shirt me noggin noggin shirt
all for me beer and tobacco
well the collar it is worn
and the sleeves they are all torn
the tail is looking out for better weather

well it's All For Me Grog me jolly jolly grog
all for me beer and tobacco
well I spent all me tin on the ladies drinkin gin
across the western ocean I will wander

Well I'm sick in the head and I haven't been to bed
since I've been ashore for me slumber
well I spent all me dough
on the ladies don't ye know
across the western ocean I will wander

well it's All For Me Grog me jolly jolly grog
all for me beer and tobacco
well I spent all me tin on the ladies drinkin gin
across the western ocean I will wander

Well it's all for me stout, my Guinness Guinness stout
all for me beer and tobacco
Well I drank a pint of stout
but it's clear coming out
and the head is looking out for better weather!

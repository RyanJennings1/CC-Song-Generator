How oft do my thoughts in their fancy take flight 
To the home of my childhood away, 
To the days when each patriot's vision seem'd bright 
Ere I dreamed that those joys should decay. 
When my heart was as light as the wild winds that blow 
Down the Mardyke through each elm tree, 
Where I sported and play'd 'neath each green leafy shade 
On the banks of my own lovely Lee. 

And then in the springtime oflaughterr and song 
Can I ever forget the sweet hours? 
With the friends of my youth as we rambled along 
'Mongst the green mossy banks and wild flowers. 
Then too, when the evening sun's sinking to rest 
Sheds its golden light over the sea 
The maid with her lover the wild daisies pressed 
On the banks of my own lovely Lee 
The maid with her lover the wild daisies pressed 
On the banks of my own lovely Lee 

'Tis a beautiful land this dear isle of song 
Its gems shed their light to the world 
And her faithful sons bore thro' ages of wrong, 
The standard St. Patrick unfurled. 
Oh! would I were there with the friends I love best 
And my fond bosom's partner with me 
We'd roam thy banks over, and when weary we'd rest 
By thy waters, my own lovely Lee, 
We'd roam thy banks over, and when weary we'd rest 
By thy waters, my own lovely Lee, 

Oh what joys should be mine ere this life should decline 
To seek shells on thy sea- girdled shore. 
While the steel-feathered eagle, oft splashing the brine 
Brings longing for freedom once more. 
Oh all that on earth I wish for or crave 
Is that my last crimson drop be for thee, 
To moisten the grass of my forefathers' grave 
On the banks of my own lovely Lee 
To moisten the grass of my forefathers' grave 
On the banks of my own lovely Lee.

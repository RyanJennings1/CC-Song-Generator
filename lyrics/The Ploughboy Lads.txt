When she was only sixteen years
A beauty she was wearing
Ah little, little did she think
That she'd be soon a-grievins oh oh

For the ploughboys lads are gay braw lads
They'll court you and deceive you
Oh they'll take all and they'll gang awas
And leave the lasses grievins oh oh

If she'd stayed home when she was told
And done her mammy's bidden oh
She'd not be sitting by yon fireside
Singin' hush abye my baby, oh oh

Hush a-bye, she's your ma
But the Lord knows who's your daddy oh
So maids take care and ye beware of the young
man in the gloamin' oh oh

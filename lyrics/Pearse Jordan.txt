A young man, was shot on the Falls Road today
The bulletins came through to hide the truth away
With different stories to cover the lies
'twas cold blooded murder, caused Pearce Jordan to die

As you travelled the Falls Road early that night.
The police, they were watching, the kept you in sight.
They rammed your car from every side
As you staggered away, you were shot, and you died.

Slan go foill moh chara, just for a while.
We'll not, have your craic, your jokes, or your smiles.
But in years to come, your memory's still true.
A brave son of Ireland, we will not forget you

Your killer that night, you did not even see.
Shot in the back, by the RUC
Now they wont be punished, though justice they'll meet
For shootin' Pearse Jordan, unarmed in the street

Slan go foill mo chara, just for a while
We'll not have your craic, your jokes, or your smiles.
But in years to come, your memory's still true
A brave son of Ireland, we will not forget you

The grief that is felt by, his family is sore.
To know that they'll never, see Pearse any more.
No chance to hold him, or tell him goodbye
But they're proud of their son, and the cause that Pearse held high

Slan go foill moh chara, just for a while
We'll not have your craic, your jokes, or your smiles.
But in years to come, your memory's still true
A brave son of Ireland we will not forget you

Slan go foill moh chara, just for a while
We'll not have your craic, your jokes, or your smiles.
But in years to come, your memory's still true
Goodbye my dear friend, we will not forget you.

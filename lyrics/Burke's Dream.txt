Sadly but slowly one night in November 
I laid down my weary head for to repose 
On my pillow of straw which I long shall remember 
I been weary for sleep, I fell into a doze. 

I been tired from working hard down in the foreign prison yard 
Night brought relief to my sad heart's should free 
I've been locked in my prison cell, surely an earthly hell 
I then fell asleep and commenced for to dream 

I dreamed I was sitting on a green hill of Erin 
With no hesitating and victory won, 
Surrounded by comrades, no enemies fearing, 
But then was the cry, "Every man to his gun" 

It's on came the section then; dread not, ye Fenian men; 
Soon they fell back from their pike's volunteers 
I dreamed that I saw our brave noble commander 
Was mounted on steed and his guard did surrear 

He was brave-trimmed with gold and his bright shining chevrons want 
'Twas all dint with sunbeams of freedom that day 
Slam bang, the cannons slew, lines they were all cut through 
Men on both sides lay dying and dead 

The green flag went waving high that day beneath the battle sky 
Everyone there did sing out gloriously 
Every man, boy was on oath bound to die that day or stand their ground 
And all from our vengeance the proud Briton fled. 

Slam bang, the cannons slew, lines they were all cut through 
Men on both sides lay dying and lay dead 
Jump out of your prison bearth, for Irishmen have done their work 
God he is with us and old Erin is free. 

I dreamed I was sleeping the night beams around me 
Whilst pitching their lights upon that bloody plain 
When friends that I once knew in soft sleep reposing 
Lay dead and in their gore. Shall I e'er see them again? 

With joy then I hastened back over the mountain track 
My mother she fainted and gave a loud scream 
Surely when I awoke just as the daylight broke 
And found I was in exile and all but a dream

Oh my name it is Sam Hall chimney sweep, chimney sweep
Oh my name it is Sam Hall chimney sweep
Oh my name it is Sam Hall and I've robbed both great
And small
And my neck will pay for all when I die, when I die
And my neck will pay for all when I die

I have twenty pounds in store, that's not all, that's
Not all
I have twenty pounds in store, that's not all
I have twenty pounds in store and I'll rob for twenty
More
For the rich must help the poor, so must I, so must I
For the rich must help the poor, so must I

Oh they took me to Cootehill in a cart, in a cart
Oh they took me to Cootehill in a cart
Oh they took me to Cootehill where I stopped to make my

Will
Saying the best of friends must part, so must I, so
Must I
Saying the best of friends must part, so must I

Up the ladder I did grope, that's no joke, that's no
Joke
Up the ladder I did grope, that's no joke
Up the ladder I did grope and the hangman pulled the
Rope
And ne'er a word I spoke, tumbling down, tumbling down
And ne'er a word I spoke tumbling down

Oh my name it is Sam Hall chimney sweep, chimney sweep
Oh my name it is Sam Hall chimney sweep
Oh my name it is Sam Hall and I've robbed both great
And small
And my neck will pay for all when I die, when I die
And my neck will pay for all when I die

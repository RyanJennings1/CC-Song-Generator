In the lowland of Creggan there lives a white hare
As swift as the swallow that flies through that air
You may tramp the world over but none can compare
With the pride of low creggan white hare

One clean autumn morning as you may suppose
The red golden sun o'er the green mountain rose
Barney Conway came down and he did declare
This day I'll put an end to that bonnie white hare

He searched through the lowlands and down through the glens
And among the wild bushes where the white hare had ends
Till at last coming home o'er the heather so bare
From behind a wild thistle jumped out the white hare

Bang bang went his gun and his dog it slipped too
As swift as the wind over the green mountain flew
But the dog soon came back wich made poor Barney sigh
For henknew that the white hare dad bid him again

We're some jolly sportsmen down here from Pomeroy
From Cookstown Dungannon and likewise the Moy
With our pedigree greyhound we've travelled afar
And we've come down to Creggan in our fine motor car

Away to the lowlands there huntsmen did go
in search to the white hare they look high and low
Till at last Barney Conway on a bog bank so bare
Shouted out to these huntsmen there lies the white hare

They call up their greyhounds from off the green lea
And Barney and the huntsmen they jump4ed high with glee
For thre on the turf bank all gathered around
Seven dogs and nine men did that poor hare surround

Now wonder the white hare did tremble with fear
As she stood on her toes and would raise her big ears
But she stood on her toes and with one gallant spring
She cleared overt overt the greyhounds and broke through the ring

Well the case i went on twas beautiful view
As swift as the wind o'er the green mountains flew
But with pedigree greyhound they didn't go far
They come back and went home in their motor car

There come another man and you all know him well
His name is Pat Devlin and Bonnie black Nell
In search of the white hare he says I'll have fun
here's fifty to one that Black Nell does her turn

Five turns the hare got then from Bonnie Black Nell
and the sixth one was given around John Haughey's well
Twas there we lost sight of the white hare and the dog
And ten minutes later they come o'er the bog

Well the chase it went on it was great for to see
The white hare and the greyhound they roamed light and free
Till she travelled to Esker where she knew the land well
And to Bonnie Black Nell she soon bid farewell

And now to counclude and finish it's time
I hope you'll forgive me for singing this rhyme
If there's any amongst you in Carrick more fair
Let's drink up a health to the bonnie white hare

I've travelled round this country
From  shore to shining shore
And I've never ceased to wonder
the things I heard and saw
 
But the banks are made of marble
With a  guard at every door
And the vaults are filled with silver
That the worker sweated for

I've seen the weary housewife, 
Buying groceries at the store
And I've heard the grocer saying
This is going to cost you more

But the banks are made of marble
With a guard at every door
And the vaults are filled with silver
That the worker sweated for.

I’ve seen the weary miner
Scrubbing coal dust from his back
And I’ve heard his children crying' 
got no coal to heat the shack.

But the banks are made of marble
With a guard at every door
And the vaults are filled with silver
That the worker sweated for.
I've seen the weary sailor,
Standing idly on the shore,
And I've heard his skipper saying
There's no berth here anymore.

But the banks are made of marble
With a guard at every door
 And the vaults are filled with silver
That the worker sweated for.
Lets rise up and take our country
Lets rise up and take our land
Let us all rise together
For together we must stand.

We'll blow up the banks of marble
With the guards on every door,
And share out the vaults of silver
That the worker sweated for.

We'll blow up the banks of marble
With the guards on every door,
And share out the vaults of silver
That the worker sweated for

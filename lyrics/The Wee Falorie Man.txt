I am the wee falorie man 
A rattling, roving Irishman, 
I can do all that ever you can 
For I am the wee falorie man. 

I have a sister Mary Ann 
She washes her face in the frying pan, 
And out she goes to hunt for a man 
I have a sister Mary Ann. 

I am a good old working man, 
Each day I carry a wee tin can 
A large penny bap and a clipe of ham 
I am a good old working man.

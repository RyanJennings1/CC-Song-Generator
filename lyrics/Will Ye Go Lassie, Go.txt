Oh the summertime is coming and the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme grows around the blooming heather

Will ye go lassie go, and we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme all around the blooming heather
Will ye go lassie go

I will build my love a tower near yon pure crystal fountain
And on it I will build all the flowers of the mountain

Will ye go lassie go, and we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme all around the blooming heather
Will ye go lassie go

If my true love she were gone I would surely find another
Where wild mountain thyme grows around the blooming heather

Will ye go lassie go, and we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme all around the blooming heather
Will ye go lassie go

Oh the summertime is coming and the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme grows around the blooming heather

Will ye go lassie go, and we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme all around the blooming heather
Will ye go lassie go

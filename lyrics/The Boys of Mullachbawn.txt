On a Monday morning early 
As my wand'ring steps did lead me, 
Down by a farmer's station, 
Of meadow and green lawn, 
I heard great lamentation 
That the wee birds they were makin' 
Sayin' "We'll have no more engagements 
With the boys of Mullaghbawn." 

Squire Jackson was un equalled 
For honour or for reason, 
He never turned a traitor 
Or betrayed the rights of man, 
But now we are endangered 
By a vile deceiving stranger 
Who has ordered deportation 
For the Boys of Mullachbawn. 

As those heroes crossed the ocean 
I'm told the ship in motion 
Did stand in wild commotion 
As if the seas ran dry, 
The trout and salmon gaping 
As the cuckoo left her station 
Sayin', "Farewell to lovely Erin 
And the hills of Mullaghbawn. 

To end my lamentation 
We are all in consternation 
For the want of education 
I here must end my song; 
None cares for recreation 
Since without consideration 
We are sent for transportation 
From the hills of Mullachbawn.

Hear it ring on the air
It's the voice of my country so fair
Oh, can't you feel, oh, can't you see
The IRA will set them free
Well, hear it ring on the air
It's the voice of my country so fair
Oh, can't you feel, oh, can't you see
The IRA will set them free

Well, in the jail that held Mc Sweeney
In the prison where he died
Lie two daughters of old Ireland
And they fill my heart with pride
For I know that England wishes
That we'd let them die alone
But all the voices of old Ireland
They cry for us to bring them home

Hear it ring on the air
It's the voice of my country so fair
Oh, can't you feel, oh, can't you see
The IRA will set them free

It was the love of dear old Ireland
That brought them to that prison hell
But the ghosts of Pearse and Connolly
They guard their lonely prison cell
And Clarke and Plunkett stand beside them
McDonagh, McDermott and Wolfe Tone
And all the voices of old Ireland
They cry for us to bring them home

Hear it ring on the air
It's the voice of my country so fair
Oh, can't you feel, oh, can't you see
The IRA will set them free

So I pray you men of Ireland
Don't betray our daughters true
Proudly stand behind our Provos
Lest they die for me and you
And though the tyrants may deny us
We shall break their hearts of stone
And all of Ireland will be singin'
When we bring our daughters home
Hear it ring on the air
It's the voice of my country so fair
Oh, can't you feel, oh, can't you see
The IRA will set them free

Hear it ring on the air
It's the voice of my country so fair
Oh, can't you feel, oh, can't you see
The IRA will set them free

Yes, the IRA will set them free

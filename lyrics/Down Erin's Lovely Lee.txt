On March the sixth in sixty three we sailed from Queenstown Quay 
A gallant band of Fenian men bound for Amerikay 
While journeying with that gallant band, as you may plainly see 
We were forced to go from sweet Cloghroe down Erin's lovely Lee 

For six long months we ploughed the sea, from Queenstown Quay in Cork 
Just like an arrow through the sky till we landed in New York 
Them Yankee boys with stars and stripes came flocking down to see 
That gallant band of Fenian men from Erin's lovely Lee 

Then one of them stepped up to me and he asked me did I know 
The hills of Tipperary or the Glen of Aherlow 
Or could I tell where Crowley fell, his native land to free 
And the tower that Captain Mackey sacked, down Erin's lovely Lee 

He also asked me did I know where Wolfe Tone's body lay 
Or could I tell the resting place of Emmet's sacred clay 
What did I know of Michael Dwyer, the Wicklow mountain lion 
And the three Manchester martyrs - Allen, Larkin and O'Brien 

Yes I can tell where Crowley fell, 'twas in Kilclooney Wood 
And the tower that Captain Mackey sacked, 'twas by his side I stood 
When he gave the word, we raised the sword and made the tyrant frown 
And we raised the green flag o'er our heads, the harp without the crown 

When I was leaving Ireland, I passed through sweet Kildare 
And if I do not now mistake, Wolfe Tone is buried there 
In coming down through Dublin Town, we passed Glasnevin too 
And its there young Robert Emmet lies, a patriot loyal and true 

But now I'm tired of roving and the seas I will cross o'er 
To feel the clasp of honest hands when I return once more 
When I go home to sweet Cloghroe the boys will welcome me 
And we'll help to float a Fenian boat, down Erin's lovely Lee.

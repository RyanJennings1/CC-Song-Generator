In a neat little town they call Belfast,
apprenticed to trade I was bound
and manys the hour of sweet happiness
I spent in that neat little town
till bad misfortune came o're me
which sent me away from the land
far away from my friends and companions
betrayed by the black velvet band

Her eyes the shined like a diamond
you'd think she was queen of the land
and her hair hung over her shoulder
tied up with a black velvet band

As I went strolling down Broadway
not intending to stray very far
I met with a frolicksome damsel
applying her trade in a bar
a watch she stole from a customer
and slipped it right into my hand
the very first day that I met her,
bad luck to the black velvet band

Her eyes the shined like a diamond
you'd think she was queen of the land
and her hair hung over her shoulder
tied up with a black velvet band

Before judge and jury next morning,
both of us were to appear
a gentleman claimed his jewelry
and the case against us was quite clear
seven long years transportation
right down to Van Dieman's Land
far away from my friends and companions
betrayed by the black velvet band

Her eyes the shined like a diamond
you'd think she was queen of the land
and her hair hung over her shoulder
tied up with a black velvet band

So come all ye jolly young fellows
I'll have you take warnin' by me
whenever you're out in the liquor me lads
beware of the pretty colleens
for they'll fill you with whiskey and porter
till you are not able to stand
and the very next thing that you know me lads,
you've landed in Van Dieman's Land

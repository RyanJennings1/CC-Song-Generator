I was born and raised in Boston,a place you all know well
Brought up by honest parents,the truth to you I'll tell
Brought up by honest parents,and raised most tenderly
Till I became a sporting lad at the age of twenty three

My character was taken and I was sent to jail
My friends they came and tried in vain to get me out on bail
The jury found me guilty,and the clerk he wrote it down
The judge he passed the sentence,I was bound for Charlestown

They placed me on an east bound train on a cold December's day
And every station we passed by you could hear the people saw
There goes the Boston burguler,in cold chains he is bound
For one crime or anothr he is bound for Charlestown

All you who have your freedom,take warning if you can
And dont go round the syreets at night,breaking laws of God or man
For if you do you'll surly loose and find yourself like me
Serving up full twenty years in a penatentury

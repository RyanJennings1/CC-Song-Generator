The vans they come in convoys now 
Stealing through the dawn 
Silent in the countryside 
In the hills up to the north 
There´s road blocks on the Meden bridge 
There´s click click clicking on the phone 
They´re sealing off our villages 
Sealing off our homes 
Her father crossed the battle lines 
In the first months of the war 
She frowns down at the soup kitchen 
She doesn´t have a father anymore 
It´s cold in the early mornings 
Standing with your mates 
Staring at the thick blue line 
Armed and ready at the gates 

This ain´t some tinpot story arriving from a distant shore 
But or own sweet green and pleasant land in 1984 

The servants of our great nation 
Have lied in the name of us all 
While the officers of peace and order 
Are busy breaking every law 
There´s hundreds on trumped-up charges 
Hundreds on the streets 
The future of our villages 
Sown with bitter seeds 

And hatred starts to rumble where there was no hate before 
In our own sweet green and pleasant land in 1984 

Nobody wanted to see the blood 
As the blue lights flash through in the night 
But all the words fell on deaf ears 
And now the blind frustration bites 

Two nations under one crown divided more and more 
In our own sweet green and pleasant land in 1984

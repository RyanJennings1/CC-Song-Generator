I'll take you home again Kathleen
Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been
Since first you were my bonny bride
The roses all have left your cheeks
I've watched them fade away and die
Your voice is sad when'er you speak
And tears bedim your loving eyes
Oh I will take you back Kathleen
To where your heart will feel no pain
And when the fields are fresh and green
I will take you to your home Kathleen

I know you love me Kathleen dear
Your heart was ever fond and true
I always feel when you are near
That life holds nothing dear but you
The smiles that once you gave to me
I scarcely ever see them now
But many many times I've seen
A darkening shadow on your brow
Oh i will take you back Kathleen
To where your heart will feel no pain
And when the fields are fresh and green
I will take you to your home Kathleen

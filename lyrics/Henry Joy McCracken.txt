An Ulster man I am proud to be
From the Antrim glens I come
And though I've laboured by the sea
I have followed fife and drum
I have heard the martial tramp of men
I've seen them fight and die
Ah! Lads it's well I remember when
I followed Henry Joy

I dragged my boat in from the shore
And I hid my sails away
I hung my nets upon a tree
And I scanned the moonlit bay
The boys were out, the red coats too
I kissed my love good-bye
And in the shade of the greenwood glade
I followed Henry Joy

It was for Ireland's cause we fought
For home and sire, we bled
'Though our numbers were few, our hearts were true
And five to one lay dead
And many a lassie mourned her lad
And mother mourned her boy
For youth was strong in the daring throng
That followed Henry Joy

In Belfast town, they built a tree
And the redcoats mustered there
I saw him come as the beat of a drum
Rolled out in the barrack square
He kissed his sister, went aloft
And waved a last good-bye
My God he died, I turned and I cried
They have murdered Henry Joy

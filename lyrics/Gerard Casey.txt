This song that I will sing of a brave young Irishman
In the struggle for freedom to free Ireland

He joined the IRA became a volunteer
To his comrades in arms he never showed fear.

Volunteer Gerard Casey freedom fighter to all
To the plight of his country he answered the call

And on active service he would never ask why
Our brave volunteer was not afraid to die

This man from North Antrim I'm sure you've all heard tell
Gerard Casey's the name, Rasharkin he did dwell.

He fought for his country he gave up his life.
For his family and friends and darling young wife.

In his younger days he lived his life to the full
Playing Gaelic Football things were not so dull.

Working with his father, serving out his time
To set Ireland free, to him it was no crime.

No stranger to harassment at the hands of the foe
He was tortured arrested to Castlereagh he go
Threatned by imprisonment and death in the end
Our brave volunteer to them he would not bend.

Cruel British assassins in the cover of dark
Headed for Rasharkin onto Shamrock Park
With their guns of terror they burst through the door
And the cowards went looking for the family man of four.

They found him with his wife his baby in bed
They sprayed English bullets and left Gerard Casey dead
The cowards had fled the sadness that night
For his wife and young family would carry on the fight.

His funeral at St. Mary's cruel forces of the crown
Large crowds defied them as the rain lashed down
The piper he played farewell at the grave
In honour of Gerard the bravest of the brave.

Our gallant volunteer North Antrim Brigade
And the rain sweped graveyard was where he was laid
Volunteers gone before him who lie in a plot
Gerard Casey and their names will never be forgot

Last night as I lay dreamin' of pleasant days gone by
Me mind been bent on ramblin' to Ireland I did fly
I stepped on board a vision and I followed with a will
when at last I came to anchor at the cross at Spancil Hill

It was on the twenty third of June the day before the fair
where Ireland's sons and daughters and friends assembled there
the young, the old, the brave and the bold came their duty to fulfill
at the little church at Clooney a mile from Spancil Hill

I went to see my neighbors to see what they might say
the old ones they were dead and gone the young ones turnin' grey
I met with Tailor Quigley, he's as bold as ever still
for he used to make me breeches when I lived in Spancil Hill

I paid a flying visit to my first and only love
she's as white as any lilly and as gentle as a dove
she threw her arms around me sayin', "Johnny, I love you still!"
she's Ned the farmer's daughter and the pride of Spancil Hill

I dreamt I hugged and kissed her as in the days of yore
she said, "Johnny, you're only jokin' as manys the times before!"
the cock he crew in the mornin' he crewed so loud and shrill
and I was back in California many miles from Spancil Hill

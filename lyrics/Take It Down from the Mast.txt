You have murdered our brave Liam and Rory
You have butchered young Richard and Joe
And your hands with our blood are still gory
Fulfilling the work of the foe

[Chorus]
So take it down from the mast, Irish traitor!
It's the flag we Republicans claim
It can never belong to free staters
For you've brought on it nothing but shame

Then leave it to those who are willing
To uphold it in war and in peace
To those men who intend to do killing
Until England's tyranny is ceased

So take it down from the mast, Irish traitor!
It's the flag we Republicans claim
It can never belong to free staters
For you've brought on it nothing but shame

We'll stand by Daly and Larkin
By the provisionals and Sullivan the bold
And we'll break down the English connections
And we'll win back the nation you sold

So take it down from the mast, Irish traitor!
It's the flag we Republicans claim
It can never belong to free staters
For you've brought on it nothing but shame

You sold out the six counties for your freedom
When we had given you McCracken and Wolfe Tone
And good Ulstermen have fought for you in Dublin
Now you watch as we fight on alone

So take it down from the mast, Irish traitor!
It's the flag we Republicans claim
It can never belong to free staters
For you've brought on it nothing but shame

And up in Ulster, we're fighting on for freedom
For our people, they yearn to be free
You executed those men who fought for us
With a hangman from over the sea

So take it down from the mast, Irish traitor!
It's the flag we Republicans claim
It can never belong to free staters
For you've brought on it nothing but shame

You have murdered our brave Liam and Rory
You have butchered young Richard and Joe
And your hands with our blood are still gory
Fulfilling the work of the foe

So take it down from the mast, Irish traitor!
It's the flag we Republicans claim
It can never belong to free staters
For you've brought on it nothing but shame

Armed for the battle kneel we before thee 
Bless thou our our banners,God for the brave!! 
Ireland is living! Shout we exulant 
Ireland is waking hands grasp the sword 
Who fights for Ireland,God guide his blows home 
Who died for Ireland,God give him peace! 
Knowing our cause just,march we triumphant 
Lying or dying Ireland to free! 
The spirit of freedom floats in the ether 
Souls of our hero's marched by out side 
Tone is out battle-cry: Emmet inspires us 
Those who for Freedom fall never shall die 
England is breaking! shout we exultant 
England is beaten - Ireland is free!!!!!! 
Charge for the old cause, down with the old foe 
Giving our hearts blood Ireland to free!

Come all you fine people wherever you be
I'll sing of a brave Belfast man
Who scorned the army's might , though they'd shoot him on sight
And they shot down Joe McCann, Joe McCann
They shot down Joe McCann.

He fought for the people of the markets where he worked.
In the defence of the rights of man
But the hired branch crew told the soldiers what to do
And they shot down Joe McCann , Joe McCann
They shot down Joe McCann.

In a Belfast bakery in the August of the year,
When internment was imposed throughout the land
Six volunteers from Belfast held six hundred troops at bay
And their leader was Joe McCann, Joe McCann,
The Leader was Joe McCann, Joe McCann.

He carried no gun so he started to run,
To escape them as many the time before
One bullet brought him down, as he lay on the ground.
They shot him ten times more, ten times more,
They shot him ten times more.
He fought for the rights of the people of this land
The Protestant and Catholic working man
He caused the bosses fear, for this they paid him dear
When they murdered brave Joe McCann, Joe McCann
They murdered brave Joe McCann.

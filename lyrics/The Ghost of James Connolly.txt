Though not born in Ireland I loved her dear lands
Her beauty, Her people, Her freedoms demands
I settled in Belfast but suffered the pain
Of seeing friends beaten tortured and maimed
I vowed that one day I would make England pay
And take up the fight in the time honoured way

I trained and I drilled , I nurtured the plan
To strike at the heart of a cruel tyrants land
We set forth to England , my comrade & me
To play our own part & to set Ireland free
We gave of our best & we stuck to our task
So remember our courage is all that we ask

Time thunders by but memories won't fade
Of these two volunteers of the Belfast Brigade
Patricia & Frankie we'll remember with pride
We honour your names, you stand side by side
Twenty years on, we salute you again
Martyrs for Ireland you'll forever remain

We may not have met you but that matters none
We'll never forget one of Ireland's brave Sons
You inspired generations to keep up the fight
"You led by example", they knew you were right
You lie among Heroes in Milltown today
The last resting place for the Bold IRA

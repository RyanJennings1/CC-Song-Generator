It being on the twenty-third of June-o 
As I sat weaving all on my loom 
I heard a thrush singing on yon bush 
And the song she sang was a jug of punch 

Ladderly fol the dee 
Ladderly fol the dee deedle eedel dum 
Dithery idle dum dithery idle deedle dum 
Dithery idle dum dithery idle deedle dum 
Dithery idle deedle eedle eedle dum dum dee 

What more pleasure could a boy desire 
Than to sit him down-o, beside the fire 
And in his hand-o a jug of punch 
Aye, and on his knee-o, a tidy wench 

What more hardships could a boy desire 
Than sit him down-o behind the door 
And in his hand-o no jug of punch 
Aye, and on his knee-o, no tidy wench 

When I am dead, all my drinking's o'er 
I'll drink one glass and I'll drink no more 
For fear I mightn't get it on that day 
I will drink it now and I'll drink away 

When I am dead and left in my mould 
At my head and feet place a flowing bowl 
And every young man that passes by 
He can have a drink and remember I

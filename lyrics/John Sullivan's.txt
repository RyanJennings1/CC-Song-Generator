Sullivan's John to the road you've gone, far away from your native home
You've gone with the tinker's daughter far along the road to roam
Sullivan's John sure you won't stick it long when your belly will soon get slack
When you're roaming the road with a mighty load and a toodle box on your back

I met Katey Coffey with her neat baby behind on her back strapped on
She'd an old ash plant all in her hand for to drive her donkey on
Enquiring at every farmer's house that along the road she passed
Where would she find an old pot to mend and where would she swap an ass

There's a hairy ass fair in the County Claire in a place they call Spancil Hill
Where my brother James got a rap on the head and poor Paddy they tried to kill
They loaded him up in an ass and cart while Kate and Mary stood by
Bad luck to the day that I went away to join with the tinkers band

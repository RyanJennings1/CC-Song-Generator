I joined the flying column in 1916, 
In Cork with Sean Moylan, in Tipperary with Dan Breen. 
Arrested by Free Staters and sentenced for to die. 
Farewell to Tipperary, said the Galtee mountain boy. 

We went across the valleys and over the hilltops green, 
Where we met with Dinny Lacey, Sean Hogan and Dan Breen 
Sean Moylan and his gallant men that kept the flag flying high. 
Farewell to Tipperary, said the Galtee mountain boy. 

We tracked the Dublin mountains, we were rebels on the run. 
Though hunted night and morning, we were outlaws but freemen. 
We tracked the Wicklow mountains as the sun was shining high, 
Farewell to Tipperary, said the Galtee mountain boy. 

I bid farewell to old Clonmel that I never more will see, 
And to the Galtee mountains that oft times sheltered me, 
The men who fought for their liberty and who died without a sigh. 
May their cause be ne'er forgotten, said the Galtee mountain boy.

It's as I was going over the Cork and Kerry Mountains
I met with Captain Farrel and his money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
sayin', "stand and deliver for I am your bold deceiver:

mush a ring a ma dor um dah
whack for the daddy Oh
whack for the daddy Oh
there's whiskey in the jar

I counted up my money and it made a pretty penny
I took that money home and I gave it to my Jenny
she promised and she vowed that she never would deceive me
but the devil take the women for they never can be easy

mush a ring a ma dor um dah
whack for the daddy Oh
whack for the daddy Oh
there's whiskey in the jar

I went into my chamber for to take a little slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder
but Jenny took my charges and filled them up with water
and sent for Captain Farrel to be ready for the slaughter

mush a ring a ma dor um dah
whack for the daddy Oh
whack for the daddy Oh
there's whiskey in the jar

It was early in the mornin' before I rose to travel
surrounded by the footmen and likewise Captain Farrel
I went for my old pistol for they'd stolen my old rapier
but I couldn't shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken

mush a ring a ma dor um dah
whack for the daddy Oh
whack for the daddy Oh
there's whiskey in the jar

If anyone can save me it's my brother in the army
I think that he is stationed in Cork or in Killarney
and if he would be here we'd be rovin' in Kilkenny
I know he'd treat be better than my darlin' sportin' Jenny

mush a ring a ma dor um dah
whack for the daddy Oh
whack for the daddy Oh
there's whiskey in the jar

Now some take delight in the fishin' and the fowlin'
others take delight in the carriage wheels a rollin
I takes delight in the juice of the barley
and countin' pretty women in the mornin' oh so early

mush a ring a ma dor um dah
whack for the daddy Oh
whack for the daddy Oh
there's whiskey in the jar

Oh Danny Boy, the pipes the pipes are calling
from glen to glen and down the mountain side
the summer's gone and all the flowers dying
it's you it's you must go andI must bide
but come ye back when summer's in the meadow
or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
it's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny Boy my Danny Boy I love you so

And when ye come and all the flowers are dying
if I am dead as dead I well may be
you'll come and find the place where I am lying
and knell and say an Ave there for me
and I shall hear tho soft ye tread above me
and all my grave will warmer sweeter be
and if you bend and tell me that you love me
than I shall sleep in peace until you come to me

Danny Boy is the story of a father who has 4 boys. The eldest 3 have all gone
off to war and been killed. Now the youngest, Danny all of 16 years old is old enough to go to war himself (the pipes, the pipes of war are calling him). His father knows the odds and realizes that Danny too will probably be a casualty. In the event Danny lives however, the father knows he's so old and broken hearted at the prospects of losing all his sons that he will die of a broken heart. This is his farewell song to his youngest son.

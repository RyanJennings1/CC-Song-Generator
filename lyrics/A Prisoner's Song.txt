Let us sing a prisoner's anthem
Let it echo through the cells
All along the halls and landings
Let our hearts and voices swell
Let us sing a prisoner's anthem
Let it echo through the cells
All along the halls and landings
Let our hearts and voices swell

Let us sing a prisoner's anthem
Let it echo through the cells
All along the halls and landings
Let our hearts and voices swell

Well, let us sing of home and loved ones
And the things that keep us sane
Of the friends who will be waitin'
When we all walk free again

 Oh, let us sing a prisoner's anthem
Let it echo through the cells
All along the halls and landings
Let our hearts and voices swell

Well, there's a part that can't be captured
In each woman and in each man
For the spirit cannot be shackled
Although they chain our feet and hands

Oh, let us sing a prisoner's anthem
Let it echo through the cells
All along the halls and landings
Let our hearts and voices swell
So come all ye screws and warders
Don't you think that, that it's a crime?
Although you do your best to break us
We still stand as we do our time

So let us sing a prisoner's anthem
Let it echo through the cells
All along the halls and landings
Let our hearts and voices swell

Oh, let us sing a Prisoners anthem
And let it echo through the cells
All along the halls and landings
Let our hearts and our spirits swell

One evening fair as the sun was shining
To Kilkenny I did ride
I did meet with Captain Brady
A tall commander by his side

Then you are welcome Highland Paddy
By my side you'll surely stand
Hear the people shout for freedom
We'll rise in the morning with the Fenian band
Rise in the morning with the Fenian band

In the mornin' we rose early
Just before the break of dawn
Blackbirds singing in the bushes
Greetings to a smiling morn'

Gather round me men of Ireland
Gather Fenians gather round
Hand to hand with sword and musket
Spill the blood upon this holy ground

Then you are welcome Highland Paddy
By my side you'll surely stand
Hear the people shout for freedom
We'll rise in the morning with the Fenian band
Rise in the morning with the Fenian band

There's a glen beside the river
Just outside Kilkenny Town
There we met this noble captain
Men lay dead upon the ground

Then you are welcome Highland Paddy
By my side you'll surely stand
Hear the people shout for freedom
We'll rise in the morning with the Fenian band
Rise in the morning with the Fenian band

There's a grave beside the river
A mile outside Kilkenny Town
There we laid our noble captain
Birds were silent when this Fenian died

All my life I will remember
I'll remember night and day
That once I rode into Kilkenny
And I heard this noble captain say

Then you are welcome Highland Paddy
By my side you'll surely stand
Hear the people shout for freedom
We'll rise in the morning with the Fenian band
Rise in the morning with the Fenian band

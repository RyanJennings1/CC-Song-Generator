The struggle is over, the boys are defeated
Old Ireland's surrounded with sadness and gloom
We were defeated and shamefuIIy treated
And I, Robert Emmet, awaiting my doom

Hung, drawn and quartered, sure that was my sentence
But soon I will show them no coward am I
My crime is the love of the land I was born in
A hero I lived and a hero I'll die

Bold Robert Emmet, the darling of Ireland
Bold Robert Emmet will die with a smile
Farewell companions both loyal and daring
I'll lay down my life for the Emerald Isle

The barque lay at anchor awaiting to bring me
Over the billows to the land of the free
But I must see my sweetheart for I know she will cheer me
And with her I will sail far over the sea

Bold Robert Emmet, the darling of Ireland
Bold Robert Emmet will die with a smile
Farewell companions both loyal and daring
I'll lay down my life for the Emerald Isle

But I was arrested and cast into prison
Tried as a traitor, a rebel, a spy
But no man can call me a knave or a coward
A hero I lived and a hero I'll die

Bold Robert Emmet, the darling of Ireland
Bold Robert Emmet will die with a smile
Farewell companions both loyal and daring
I'll lay down my life for the Emerald Isle

Hark! I the bell's tolling, I well know its meaning
My poor heart tells me it is my death knell
In come the clergy, the warder is leading
I have no friends here to bid me farewell
Goodbye, old Ireland, my parents and sweetheart
Companions in arms to forget you must try
I am proud of the honour, it was only my duty
A hero I lived and a hero I'll die

Oh I've never seen old Ireland o'er the ocean
Tho' I've wished for the chance to greet it
In my mind I've always had a crazy notion
That I'd know a bit of Irish when I meet it

Did your mother come from Ireland?
'Cos there's something in you Irish
Will you tell me where you get those Irish eyes
And before she left Killarney
Did your mother kiss the Blarney?
'Cos your little touch of brogue you can't disguise

Oh I wouldn't be romancin'
I can almost see you dancin'
While the Kerry pipers play
Shure! And maybe we'll be sharin
in the shamrock you'll be wearing
On the next Saint Patrick's Day

Did your mother come from Ireland?
'Cos there's something in you Irish
And that bit of Irish steals my heart away

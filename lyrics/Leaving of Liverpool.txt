Farewell to you my own true love
I'm sailing far far away
I'm bound for California
but I know that I'll return some day

So fare thee well, my own true love
When I return united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grievs me
But my darling when I think of thee

Farewell to Prince's Landing Stage
River Mersey, fare thee well
I am bound for California
A place I know right well

So fare thee well, my own true love
When I return united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grievs me
But my darling when I think of thee

I'm bound off for California
By the way of stormy Cape Horn
And I'm bound to write you a letter, love
When I am homeward bound

So fare thee well, my own true love
When I return united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grievs me
But my darling when I think of thee

I have signed on a Yankee sailing ship
Davy Crockett I do tell
And the captian's name it is Burgess
And they say she's a floating Hell

So fare thee well, my own true love
When I return united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grievs me
But my darling when I think of thee

I have shipped with Burgess once before
And I think I know him well
If a man's a seaman, he can get along
If not, then he's sure in Hell

So fare thee well, my own true love
When I return united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grievs me
But my darling when I think of thee

Farewell to lower Frederick Street
Ensign Terrace and Park Lane
For I think it will be a long, long time
Before I see you again

So fare thee well, my own true love
When I return united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grievs me
But my darling when I think of thee

Oh the sun is on the harbor, love
And I wish I could remain
For I know it will be a long, long time
until I see you again

So fare thee well, my own true love
When I return united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grievs me
But my darling when I think of thee

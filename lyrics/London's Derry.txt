So come on out ye British Huns
Come on out without your guns
Show us how you won your medals up in Derry
When you murdered fourteen men
And you'd do the same again
So get out of here and take your English border
Well, in the summer of '69
With your smilin' face you came
To show us all your pacifyin' tactics
But your true face soon came through
And your flag red, white and blue
Showed us all the Black and Tans were back in Ireland

So come on out ye British Huns
Come on out without your guns
Show us how you won your medals up in Derry
When you murdered fourteen men
And you'd do the same again
So get out of here and take your English border

Well, of your fist we've had our fill
And we know you always will
With excuses for the murderin' of Irish men
But we'll fight for our proud land
Til in unity we stand
From England we will shift our lovely island

 So come on out ye British Huns
Come on out without your guns
Show us how you won your medals up in Derry
When you murdered fourteen men
And you'll do the same again
So get out of here and take your English border

IRA!

At your trial in Coleraine
Sure we knew you weren't to blame
And likewise neither were the Huns of h*****
But don't you fret for those you slew
For your judge was British too
And we all know the English are impartial

So come on out ye British Huns
Come on out without your guns
Show us how you won your medals up in Derry
When you murdered fourteen men
And you'd do the same again
So get out of here and take your English border
So come on out ye British Huns
Come on out without your guns
Show us how you won your medals up in Derry
When you murdered fourteen men
And you'd do the same again
So f*** off home and take your English border

So come on out ye British Huns
Come on out without your guns
Show us how you won your medals up in Derry
When you murdered fourteen men
And you'd do the same again
So get out of here and take your English border

Come on out ye British Huns
Come on out without your guns

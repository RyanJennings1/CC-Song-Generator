Our act is done our freedom's won hurrah for the Volunteers
No laws beyond but those alone of our Commons, king and peers
The chain is broke the Saxon yoke from our fair neck was taken
Dungannon spoke Ireland awoke with fear was England shaken

When Grattan rose none dared oppose the claim he made for freedom
They knew our words to back his words were ready if he need them
Then let us raise to Grattan's praise a proud and joyous anthem
And welcome grace and length of days may God in mercy grant them

Bless Harry Flood who nobly stood by us through gloomy years
Lest Charlemont the brave the good the chief of the Volunteers
The North began the North held on the strife for later land
Till Ireland rose and cowed her foes God bless the northern land

God bless the men of patriot pen swift Molyneux and Lucas
Bless sword and gun which free
Trade won bless God who ne'er forsook us
And long may last the friendship fast which binds us all together
While we agree our foes shall flee like clouds in stormy weather

Remember still through good and ill how vain were prayers and tears
How vain were words till flashed the swords of the Irish Volunteers
By arms we've got the rights we've
Sought through long and wretched years
Hurrah, 'tis done our freedom won, hurrah for the Volunteers

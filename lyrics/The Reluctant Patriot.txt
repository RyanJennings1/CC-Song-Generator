"Oh Paddy dear, and did hear the awful things they say?
Princess Margret and Lord Snowden, they have joined the IRA
They are drilling in the mountains to the sounds of fife and drum
Young Tony's taking snapshots while young Maggie fires the gun!"
While young Maggie fires the gun, while young Maggie fires the gun
Young Tony's taking snapshots while young Maggie fires the gun

When the news reached Mother England filled the good queen with delight
She reared upon Prince Phillip in the middle of the night
Said she, "Get you your Rolls-Royce out, and get you ready quick and soon
For we must reach dear ould Ireland by the rising of the moon!"
By the rising of the moon, by the rising of the moon
For we must reach dear ould Ireland by the rising of the moon

When the news reached Dublin Castle De Valera danced for joy
"Ah said he, "That Jones De camera, he's a decent Irish boy
And the dear one Princess Margret, that Ireland's sweet colleen
I knew her uncle very well, he came from Skibbereen"
He came from Skibbereen, he came from Skibbereen
I knew her uncle very well, he came from Skibbereen

"Oh then Paddy dear and did you hear there's trouble in the land
For the Queen and De Valera are walking hand in hand
And the most disgraceful thing me boys, that you have ever seen
Was Prince Pillip playing polo on an ass in Stephen's Green
On an ass in Stephen's Green, on an ass in Stephen's Green
Prince Phillip's playing polo on an ass in Stephen's Green

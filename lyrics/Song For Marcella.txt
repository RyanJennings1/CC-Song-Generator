Doesn't seem quite so long ago,
The last time that I saw you,
Ain't it funny how the memories grow,
They always fold around you,
They tried to break you in a living hell,
But they couldn't find a way,
So they killed you in a H-Block cell,
And hoped that all would turn away,
Thought that your spirit couldn't rise again
But it dared to prove them wrong,
And in death you tore away the chains,
And let the world hear Freedom's Song

Yet the heartache and pain linger on,
They're still here though its so long since you have gone,
But we're stronger now you showed us how,
How freedom fight can be won

I wish there was an easy road to chose,
To bring the heartache to an end,
But easy roads are always sure to lose,
I've seen that time and time again,
If you can stand by me like yesterday,
I'll find the strength to carry on,
So let your spirit shine along the way,
And our day will surely come

Yet the heartache and pain linger on,
They're still here though its so long since you have gone,
But we're stronger now you showed us how,
How freedom fight can be won, if we all stand as one

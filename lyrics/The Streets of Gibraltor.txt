Sad are three homes in Belfast now
Old Ireland shares their sorrow
Braid Farrell, Sean Savage, and Daniel MacCann
They died on the streets of Gibraltar

They flew out of Belfast with an ambitious plan
To continue the struggle to free Ireland
Braid Farrell, Sean Savage and Daniel MacCann
And they dies on the streets of Gibraltar

Sad are three homes in Belfast now
Old Ireland shares their sorrow
As they walked in the sun the Brits drew their guns
And blood stained the streets of Gibraltar

The SAS stood there so proud of their deed
Three more freedom fighters lay dead in the street
Theyve been given no warning no chance to retreat
For three had to die in Gibraltar

Sad are three homes in Belfast now
Old Ireland shares their sorrow
As they walked in the sun the Brits drew their guns
And blood stained the streets of Gibraltar

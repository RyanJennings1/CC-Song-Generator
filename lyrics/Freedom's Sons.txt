At Easter time, nineteen-sixteen
When flowers bloomed and leaves were green
There dawned a day when freedom's cry
Called out brave men to fight and die

They were the men with a vision, the men with a cause
The men who defied their oppressor's laws
The men who traded their chains for guns
Born into slav'ry, they were Freedom's Sons

In Dublin town, they fought and died
With Pearse, McDermott and McBride
"Ourselves alone!" their battle cry
And freedom sang to the Easter sky

They were the men with a vision, the men with a cause
The men who defied their oppressor's laws
The men who traded their chains for guns
Born into slav'ry, they were Freedom's Sons

A poet's dream had sparked a flame
A raging fire, it soon became
And from that fire of destiny
There rose a nation proud and free

They were the men with a vision, the men with a cause
The men who defied their oppressor's laws
The men who traded their chains for guns
Born into slav'ry, they were Freedom's Sons

Six counties are in bondage still
They died brave men, was this their will?
When they are free and oppressions cease
Only then brave men can rest in peace

They were the men with a vision, the men with a cause
The men who defied their oppressor's laws
The men who traded their chains for guns
Born into slav'ry, they were Freedom's Sons

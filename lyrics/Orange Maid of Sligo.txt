On Ben Bulben's green and lofty height 
The evening sun was a setting bright 
It gave a ray of a golden light 
Around the Bay of Sligo 

A tiny craft with glancing oars 
And spreading sails, the wind before 
It blew the tiny craft ashore 
To this, the Bay of Sligo 

And at the bow there sat a girl 
With lovely cheeks and flaxen curl 
Her tender beauty was like a pearl 
T'was the Orange maid of Sligo 

And glancing o'er the vessel's side 
She saw upon the water's glide 
An orange lily's golden pride 
Upon the Bay of Sligo 

"Make haste, make haste and save that flower 
I prize it more than any other 
No traitor shall have it within his power 
Around the Bay of Sligo" 

An Orange youth then made a vow, 
Brought back that flower and with a bow 
Bestowed it on the lovely brow 
Of the orange maid of Sligo 

She soon became his lovely bride 
And oft they thought at even tide 
Upon that lily's golden pride 
Around the Bay of Sligo 

Come all true blues and fill your glass 
A better toast will never pass 
We'll drink unto that lovely lass 
The Orange Maid of Sligo

T'was down by Christ Church that I first met Annie
A neat little girl and not a bit shy
She told me her father who came from Dungannon
Would take her back home
In the sweet by and by

Chorus
And what's it to any man whether or no
Whether it's easy or whether I'm true
As I lifted her petticoat easy and slow
And I tied up me sleeves for to buckle her shoe

All along Thomas Street down to the Liffey
The sunshine was gone and the vening grew dark
Along by King's Bridge and begod in a jiffy
Me arms were around her beyong in the park

From city or country, a girl's a jewel
And well known for gripping the most of them are
But any young fella is really a fool
If he tries at the first time to go a bit far

And if ever you go to the town of Dungannon
You can search till your eyeballs are empty or blind
Be yeh lyin' or walkin' or sittin' or runnin'
A girl like Annie, you never will find

Raised on songs & stories Heroes of renown
The passing tales & glories That once was Dublin Town
The hallowed halls and houses The haunting children's rhymes
That once was Dublin City In the rare ould times.

Ring a Ring a Rosey
As the light declines
I'll remember Dublin City
In the rare ould Times.

My name it is Sean Dempsey
As Dublin as could be
Born hard & late in Pimlico
In a house that ceased to be
By trade I was a cooper
Lost out to redundancy
Like my house that fell to progress
my trade's a memory

I courted Peggy Dignan

As pretty as you please.
A rogue and child of Mary from the rebel liberties
I lost her to a student chap
With skin as back as coal
When he took her off to Birmingham
She took away my soul.

Ring a Ring a Rosey
As the light declines
I'll remember Dublin City
In the rare ould Times.

The years have made me bitter
The gargle dims my brain
'cause Dublin keeps on changing
and nothing seems the same.
The Pillar and the Met have gone
the Royal long since pulled down
As the grey unyielding concrete
makes a city of my town.

Fare thee well sweet Anna Liffy
I can no longer stay
And watch me new glass cages
that spring up along me Ouay
My mind's too full of memories
too old to hear new chimes
l'm a part of what was Dublin
in the rare ould times.

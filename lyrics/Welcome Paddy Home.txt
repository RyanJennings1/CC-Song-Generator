I am a true born Irish man
I'll never deny what I am
I was born in old Tipperary town
three thousand miles away

hooray my boys, hooray
no more do I wish for to roam
the sun it will shine in the harvest time
to welcome Paddy home

Now the girls they are young and they're frisky
they'll take you by the hand
sayin' Timmy Machree won't you come home with me
for to welcome a stranger home

Hooray my boys, hooray
no more do I wish for to roam
the sun it will shine in the harvest time
to welcome Paddy home

Then came the far away strangers
they settled all over the land
the horse and the plow, the colt and the sow
fell into the stranger's hands

Hooray my boys, hooray
no more do I wish for to roam
the sun it will shine in the harvest time
to welcome Paddy home

The scotsman can boast of the Thistle
The Englishman boast of the rose
by Paddy can boast of the Emerald Isle
where the dear little shamrocks grow

Hooray my boys, hooray
no more do I wish for to roam
the sun it will shine in the harvest time
to welcome Paddy home

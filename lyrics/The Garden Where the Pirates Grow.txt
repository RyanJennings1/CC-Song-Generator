Have you ever been in love, me boys?
Oh! have you felt the pain?
I'd rather be in jail, me boys/myself
Than be in love again
For the girl I loved was beautiful
I'd have you all to know
And I met her in the garden
Where the praties grow

She was just the sort of creature, boys
That nature did intend
To walk right through the world, me boys
Without a Grecian Bend
Nor did she wear a chignon
I'd have you all to know
And I met her in the garden
Where the praties grow

Said I, "My pretty/lovely colleen
I hope you'll pardon me/hope that you agree"
And she wasn't like the city girls
Who'd say "You're making free"
She looked at me right modestly/honestly
And curtsied very low
"Sure, you're welcome in the garden
Where the praties grow"

She was just the sort of creature, boys
That nature did intend
To walk right through the world, me boys
Without a Grecian Bend
Nor did she wear a chignon
I'd have you all to know
And I met her in the garden
Where the praties grow

Says I, "My lovely darling/pretty Colleen
I'm tired of single life
And if you've no objections
I will make you my sweet wife."
Says she, "I'll ask my parents
And tomorrow I'll let you know
If you'll meet me in the garden/
and i mmet you in the garden
Where the praties grow"

She was just the sort of creature, boys
That nature did intend
To walk right through the world, me boys
Without a Grecian Bend
Nor did she wear a chignon
I'd have you all to know
And I met her in the garden
Where the praties grow

Her parents they consented
And we're blessed with children three:
Two girls just like their mother
And a boy the image of me
We'll train them up in decency
The way they ought to go
And we'll send them to the garden
Where the praties grow

She was just the sort of creature, boys
That nature did intend
To walk right through the world, me boys
Without a Grecian Bend
Nor did she wear a chignon
I'd have you all to know
And I met her in the garden
Where the praties grow

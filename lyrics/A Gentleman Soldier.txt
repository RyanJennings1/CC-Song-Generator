Well it's of a gentleman soldier as a sentry he did stand
He saluted the fair maid by a waving of his hand
So boldly then he kissed her and he passed it off as a joke
He drilled her up in the sentry-box wrapped up in a soldier's cloak
And the drums they go with a rat-a-ta-tat and the fifes they loudly play
Fare thee well, Polly me dear, I must be going away

All night they tossed and tumbled till daylight did appear
The soldier rose, pulled on his clothes, saying, "Fare ye well, me dear
For the drums they are a sounding, and the fifes they sweetly play
If it weren't for that, dear Polly, then along with you I'd stay."

"Oh come, ye gentleman soldier, won't you marry me?"
"Oh no, me dearest Polly, such things never can be
For I've a wife already and children I have three
Two wives are allowed in the army but one's too many for me

If anyone comes a courting you can treat them to a glass
If anyone comes a courting you can say you're a country lass
You don't have to tell them that ever you played this joke
That you were drilled in a sentry box wrapped up in a soldier's cloak

"Oh come ye gentleman soldier, why didn't you tell me so?
My parents will be angry when this they come to know."
And when nine long months had come and passed, this poor girl she brought shame
She had a little militia-boy and she didn't know his name

Take me home to Mayo
across the Irish Sea
Home again in Mayo
where once I roamed so free
Take me home to Mayo
and let my body lie
Home at last in Mayo
beneath an Irish sky

My name is Michael Gaughan
From Ballina I came
I saw my people sufferin'
and swore to break their chains
I took the boat to England
prepared to fight or die
Far away from Mayo
beneath and English Sky Chorus

Take me home to Mayo
across the Irish Sea
Home again in Mayo
where once I roamed so free
Take me home to Mayo
and let my body lie
Home at last in Mayo
beneath an Irish sky

My body's cold and hungry
in Parkhurst Jail I lie
for the loving of my country
on hunger strike I'll die
I have but one last longing
I pray you'll not deny
bury me in Mayo
beneath my Irish sky Chorus

Take me home to Mayo
across the Irish Sea
Home again in Mayo
where once I roamed so free
Take me home to Mayo
and let my body lie
Home at last in Mayo
beneath an Irish sky

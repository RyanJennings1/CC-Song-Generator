Oh my lovely Rose of Clare, 
You're the sweetest girl I know.
You're the Queen of all the roses, 
Like the pretty flowers that grow.
You are the sunshine of my life, so beautiful and fair.
And I will always love you, my lovely Rose of Clare.

The sun, it shone out like a jewel, 
On the lovely Rose of Clare.
As I strolled along with my sweet love, 
One evening at the fair.
Her eyes they shone like silver threads, 
With her long long golden hair.
I stole the heart of a young sweet lass, 
My lovely Rose of Clare.

Now we walk down by the river banks, 
Where the lovely Shannon lies.
And listen to the nightingales, 
Singing songs for you and I.
And now to say goodbye, farewell, 
To all you people there.
For I have stole the heart of one, 
My lovely Rose of Clare.

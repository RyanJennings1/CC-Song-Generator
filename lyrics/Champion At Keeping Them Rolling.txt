I am an old-timer, I travel the road,
I sit in me wagon and lumber me load.
Me hotel is the jungle â€“ the caff me abode.
And I`m well known to Blondie and Mary.
Me liquor is diesel oil laced with strong tea
And the old Highway Code was me first ABC
And I cut me eye-teeth on an old AEC
And I`m champion at keeping them rolling.

I`ve sat in the cabin and broiled in the sun
Been snowed up on Shap on the Manchester run.
I`ve crawled through the fog with me twenty-two ton
Of fish that was stinking like blazes.
From London to Glasgow to the Newcastle quay
From Liverpool, Preston and Bristol city
The polones on the road give the thumb sign to me
But I`m champion at keeping them rolling.

You might sing of your your soldiers and sailors so bold
But there`s many and many a hero untold
Who sits at the wheel in the the heat and the cold,
Day after day without sleeping.
So watch out for cops and slow down at the bend
Check all your gauges and watch your big end.
And zig with your lights when you pass an old friend.
You`ll be champion at keeping them rolling.

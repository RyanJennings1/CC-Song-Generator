Tim Finnegan lived on Walken Street
a gentle Irishman tho mighty odd
he'd a beautiful brogue so rich and sweat
and to rise in the world he carried a hod
but Tim had a sort of a tippling' way
with the love of the liquor Tim was born
and to help him on his way each day
he'd a drop of the crather every morn

Whack for the hurrra dance your partner
round the floor ye trotters shake
isn't it the truth I tell you
lots of fun at Finegan's wake

One day when Tim was rather full
his head felt heavy which made him shake
he fell off a ladder and broke his skull
and they carried him off a corpse to wake
they carried him off in a nice clean sheet
and laid him out upon the bed
with a gallon of porter by his feet
and a noggin' of whiskey by his head

His friends assembled at the wake
and Mrs. Finegan call for lunch
first they brought out tay and cakes
and pipes and tobacco and whiskey punch
then Biddy O'Brien began to cry
"such a lovely corpse have you ever seen"
Oh Tim Avoreen why did you did?"
"OH shut your gob!", said Biddy McGee

Then Peggy O'Connor took up the job
"Oh Biddy" she said, "You're wrong I'm sure!"
Biddy gave her a belt in the gob
and sent her sprawling opon on floor
Each side in a war soon did engage
was woman to woman and man to man
Shillelagh law was all the rage
and a row and a ruction soon began

Then Mickey Maloney ducked his head
when a noggin' of whiskey flew at him
it missed and landed on the bed
and the whiskey splattered all over Tim
"Begad! He revives! See how he rises!"
Tim avoreen leaping from the bed
running all around like blazes
"Thunderin' blazes! You think I'm Dead?"

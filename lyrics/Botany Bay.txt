As I roved out this mornin',
where the ship at anchor lays
to cammand a band of navies,
that I was to engage
well I thought I'd stop in for a drink
before I went away
for to take a trip on an emmigrant ship
to the shores of Botany Bay

Farewell to your bricks and morter,
farewell to your dirty lies
farewell to your gangers and gangplanks,
farewell to your overtime
for the good ship "Ragamuffin"
is standin' at the key
for to take out Pat with a shovel on his back
to the shores of Botany Bay

Well the boss came down this morning',
he said, "Well Pat you know?"
"If you don't get your navies out
I afraid you'll have to go"
so I asked him for my wages
and demanded all my pay
and I told him straight I was going to emmigrate
to the shores of Botany Bay

Farewell to your bricks and morter,
farewell to your dirty lies
farewell to your gangers and gangplanks,
farewell to your overtime
for the good ship "Ragamuffin"
is standin' at the key
for to take out Pat with a shovel on his back
to the shores of Botany Bay

And when I reach Austrailia,
I'll go and dig for gold
there's plenty there for diggin' of
or so I have been told
or else I'll go back to my trade
and a hundred bricks I'll lay
for I work all day for eight hours pay
on the shores of Botany Bay

Farewell to your bricks and morter,
farewell to your dirty lies
farewell to your gangers and gangplanks,
farewell to your overtime
for the good ship "Ragamuffin"
is standin' at the key
for to take out Pat with a shovel on his back
to the shores of Botany Bay

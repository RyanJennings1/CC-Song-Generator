Oh as I came home on a Monday Night
As drunk as drunk could be
I thought I saw a horse outside
where my old horse should be
So I called the wife and I says to her
"Won't you kindly tell to me?
Who owns that horse outside the door
where my old horse should be?"

Ohhhh!
You're drunk you're drunk you silly old fool
as drunk as drunk can be
why that's a lovely sow my mother sent to me


But manys a days I traveled
a hundred miles or more
but...
a saddle on a sow... I've never seen that before

Oh as I came home on a Tuesday Night
As drunk as drunk could be
I thought I saw a sweater hanging

where my old sweater should be?"

Ohhhh!
You're drunk you're drunk you silly old fool
as drunk as drunk can be

but...

Oh as I came home on a Wednesday Night
As drunk as drunk could be

where my old pipe should be?"

Ohhhh!
You're drunk you're drunk you silly old fool

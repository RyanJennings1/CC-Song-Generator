I was born on a Dublin street where the royal drums did beat
And the loving English feet they went all over us
And every single night when me dad would came home tight
He'd invite the neighbors out with this chorus

Come out ye Black and Tans, come out and fight me like a man
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders
Tell them how the IRA made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra

Come tell us how you slew them poor Arabs two by two
Like the Zulus they had spears and bows and arrows
How you bravely you faced one with your 16-pounder gun
And you frightened them natives to their marrow

Come out ye Black and Tans, come out and fight me like a man
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders
Tell them how the IRA made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra

Come let us hear you tell how you slandered great Parnell
When you thought him well and truly persecuted
Where are the sneers and jeers that you bravely let us hear
When our heroes of '16 were executed?

Come out ye Black and Tans, come out and fight me like a man
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders
Tell them how the IRA made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra

Come out ye Black and Tans, come out and fight me like a man
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders
Tell them how the IRA made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra
